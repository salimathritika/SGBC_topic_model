       " '<h>Background<h><p>Patients suffering from refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) who have undergone deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery require repeated in-person programming visits. These sessions could be labor-intensive and may not always be feasible, particularly when in-person hospital visits are restricted. Telemedicine is emerging as a potential supplementary tool for post-operative care. However, its reliability and feasibility still require further validation due to the unconventional methods of interaction.<p><h>Methods<h><p>A study was conducted on three patients with refractory OCD who had undergone DBS. Most of their programming sessions were completed via a remote programming system. These patients were recruited and monitored for a year. Changes in their clinical symptoms were assessed using the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scaleâ\\x80\\x93Second Edition (Y-BOCS-II), the Hamilton Anxiety Scale-14 (HAMA), the Hamilton Depression Scale-17 (HAMD), and the Short Form 36 Health Survey Questionnaire (SF-36).

These patients also experienced some mood benefits. All patients observed a decrease in travel expenses during the study period. No severe adverse events were reported throughout the study.<p><h>Conclusion<h><p>The group of patients showed improvement in their OCD symptoms within a 1-year follow-up period after DBS surgery, without compromising safety or benefits.

Herein, we reported case of a 14-year-old teenager who initially presented with the symptoms of acute myelitis (AM). Subsequently, the patient developed symptoms consistent with Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome (GBS), which was supported by nerve conduction studies (NCV) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. Throughout the course of the disease, the patient experienced abdominal pain and abnormal liver function. After a comprehensive evaluation, we determined that the abnormal liver function was a result of hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection, which may have acted as a trigger for GBS. The patient was treated with corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin and Rituximab, resulting in symptom relief and clinical improvement after therapy and follow-up. This case highlights the potential responsiveness and reversibility of CCPD. Given the heterogeneous nature of CCPD, there is currently no standardized diagnostic criteria or clear consensus on its treatment. Therefore, we recommend a thorough assessment of all possibilities and the development of consolidated management guidelines based on available data for this disorder.<p>',\n",

His neurological examination and fundoscopy were unremarkable. Gadolinium-enhanced brain MRI demonstrated increased T2 hyperintensity within the right sub-lenticular basal ganglia, with additional leptomeningeal enhancement along the bilateral perisylvian regions and mesial temporal lobes.

Cell-based assays for anti-aquaporin-4, anti-myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein, autoimmune encephalitis panel, and vasculitis workup were all negative, except for CSF positivity for GFAP Î± antibody. Oncological screening, including CT of the chest, abdomen, pelvis, and scrotal US, was unremarkable.

We report a young female patient with atypical PKAN, harboring a novel heterozygous PANK2 mutation, diagnosed through clinical imaging and genetic analysis. The patient presented with dystonia and motor dysfunction after onset, but early brain MRI showed normal findings. Due to progressive symptom deterioration, her MRI was reevaluated and the characteristic â\\x80\\x9ceye of the tigerâ\\x80\\x9d sign was identified. Further genetic testing revealed that she was a carrier of two heterozygous PANK2 mutations, one being a known pathogenic variant and the other unknown. Given the patientâ\\x80\\x99s clinical presentation, progressive symptoms, and poor response to medication, we boldly attempted asymmetric bilateral deep brain stimulation (abDBS). Postoperative outcomes showed significant symptom improvement. This study suggests that early brain MRI in PKAN patients may not exhibit typical radiological features, leading to potential diagnostic omissions. Furthermore, it highlights the potential therapeutic effect of abDBS in atypical PKAN, particularly in patients with novel heterozygous PANK2 mutations. Asymmetric bilateral deep brain stimulation may represent a promising treatment approach.<p>',\n",

Due to the low sensitivity of routine microscopy, culture, polymerase chain reaction and antibody testing, mNGS may have more advantages in diagnosing neuroleptospirosis. As autoimmune encephalitis can be triggered by various infections, neuroleptospirosis may be one of the causes of autoimmune encephalitis. Since neuronal antibody measurements themselves are not that common in neuroleptospirosis, future studies are needed to determine whether the detection of anti-DPPX antibodies is a rare event in leptospirosis. Early identification of autoimmune encephalitis and timely administration of immunotherapy may lead to a better outcome.<p><h>Supplementary Information<h><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12883-024-03538-x.<p>',\n",

As far as we know, we are the first to report the relief of involuntary vocalizations in a patient with GPi-DBS treatment, and that salivation and involuntary trunk movements have almost disappeared, and all other symptoms are significantly relieved, which is rare in previous cases. All of the above proves that the treatment of our case with DBS was very successful and that longer term follow-up is critical. We also hope that our case will provide new references and therapeutic ideas for the future treatment of patients with ChAc.<p>',\n",

In addition, we describe the novel use of subcutaneous tocilizumab for this indication. This is followed by a review of the literature on this topic.<p><h>Case<h><p>The patient was a 28-year-old lady of Southern Chinese origin with a known history of Behcetâ\\x80\\x99s disease with oral ulcers and ocular findings for which she was on mycophenolate mofetil and adalimumab. She presented with a headache and bilateral disc swelling associated with an intracranial pressure (ICP) of >â\\x80\\x8940cmH20. There were no structural lesions or cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) on imaging. Initial lumbar puncture had raised leucocytes and protein. We discuss diagnostic challenges given persistently elevated ICP despite subsequent non-inflammatory cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) profiles and non-response to acetazolamide. She eventually showed a response to immunosuppressant therapy in the form of pulsed methylprednisolone, cyclophosphamide and subsequently subcutaneous tocilizumab, supporting the diagnosis of NBrIHwCVT. Complete normalization of ICP remains challenging. Her disease course was severe, unusual for her ethnicity.<p><h>Literature review<h><p>We identified 34 patients (including ours) from 14 publications. We found that the majority of NBrIHwCVT patients were young (average age of 34 years), with a slight female preponderance. Of the 17 cases in the literature with available data on CSF profile, none had raised leucocytes whilst one patient had elevated protein. Patients were generally treated with steroids and occasionally azathioprine, in line with the suspected autoimmune pathophysiology. Of 22 patients with data on outcome, six (27%) were noted to have recurrence of symptoms generally occurring a few months later.<p><h>Conclusion<h><p>As demonstrated by this case, NBrIHwCVT can present with BD with raised ICP even if there is no prior history of NB, central Asian ethnicity, cerebral venous thrombosis or features of inflammation on the CSF. We demonstrated how novel use of Tocilizumab may have a role in the management of NBrIHwCVT. Based on our literature review, patients were more likely to be young, female, display a non-inflammatory CSF picture, be treated with steroids and harbour a possibility of recurrence.<p>',\n",

We evaluated the cause and disease activity of PML, focusing on the longitudinal assessment of lymphocytopenia, JC virus (JCV) DNA copy number in the cerebrospinal fluid, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings. Discontinuing azathioprine and initiating alternative immunosuppressive treatments with intramuscular vitamin B12 injections affected lymphocytopenia and disease management. However, despite recovery from lymphopenia and JCV DNA copy number being low, the large hyperintense and punctate lesions observed on the fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images exhibited varying behaviors, indicating that the balance between contributing factors for PML may have fluctuated after the initial treatment. Clinicians should be meticulous when assessing the underlying pathology of the multifactorial causes of PML due to SLE.

The non-dominant hemisphere is responsible for both body sides, while the dominant hemisphere is responsible for the contralateral hemi-body. Furthermore, the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) participates in a network involved in spatial orientation, attention, and spatial and episodic memory. Laser interstitial thermotherapy (LiTT) is a minimally invasive surgery for focal drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) that can target deeper brain regions, and thus, region-specific symptoms can emerge. Here, we present an 18-year-old right-handed male with focal DRE who experienced seizures characterized by sensations of dÃ©jÃ\\xa0 vu, staring spells, and language disruption. A comprehensive evaluation localized the seizure focus and revealed a probable focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) in the left posterior cingulate gyrus. The patient underwent uneventful LiTT of the identified lesion. Post-operatively, he developed transient ipsilateral spatial neglect and contralateral sensory loss, as well as acalculia. His sensory symptoms gradually improved after the surgery, and he remained seizure-free after the intervention for at least 10 months (until the time of this writing). This rare case of ipsilateral spatial and visual hemineglect post-LiTT in epilepsy underscores the importance of recognizing atypical neurosurgical outcomes and considering individual variations in brain anatomy and function.

NMH predominantly affects patients with compressive radiculopathy (68.4%), negligible muscular weakness (93.3%), and a chronic increase in muscle bulk. A striking finding in most neurophysiological studies (60.0%) is profuse spontaneous discharges, often hindering the analysis of voluntary traces. Some patients exhibited features consistent with more significant muscle damage, including higher creatine phosphokinase levels, muscle pain, and inflammatory muscle infiltration. These patients are sometimes referred to in literature as â\\x80\\x9cfocal myositis.â\\x80\\x9d Treatment encompassed corticosteroid, Botulinum Toxin A, decompressive surgery, antiepileptic medications, and nerve blocks, demonstrating varying degrees of efficacy.

       " \"<p>Focal muscle vibration (FMV) is increasingly being recognized as a rehabilitative therapy for enhancing motor function in central nervous system (CNS) diseases, particularly in patients with fine motor control deficits stemming from CNS damage. Brain lesions from these diseases disrupt the motor networks, necessitating novel rehabilitation strategies. By applying vibrations to muscles, FMV stimulates sensory fibers to induce cortical activity and kinesthetic illusions. While initial studies have highlighted FMV's role in reducing spasticity, recent evidence points to its potential in treating motor paralysis. However, prior research has been limited by the lack of acute-phase studies and a focus on patients with minimal muscle contraction capability. This report aimed to explore FMV's efficacy on upper limb motor function in patients with flaccid motor paralysis immediately after acute CNS diseases. We report the case of a septuagenarian male with a brain abscess in the right parietal lobe, leading to flaccid motor paralysis. Rehabilitation included 28 sessions of occupational and physical therapy that incorporated FMV. Significant improvements were observed in upper extremity function, with moderate to very large effect sizes, while lower limb function showed lesser improvement without adverse effects. This case suggests the utility of FMV in enhancing upper-limb motor function after acute CNS injuries, potentially serving as a supplementary therapy for spontaneous recovery.

       " '<p>Lesions at the cerebellopontine angle (CP angle) are associated with various brain-heart interactions, which can include those from stimulation of the fifth cranial nerve along the scalp incision in a retrosigmoid suboccipital surgical approach. A 27-year-old male patient with recently diagnosed hypertension (on calcium channel blocker) underwent left CP angle lesion decompression. Transient episodes of bradycardia, hypotension, and bradypnea were observed from the skin incision onward, exacerbated during tumor manipulation. Most episodes subsided with cessation of the surgical stimulus while some required intervention. Postoperatively, blood pressure decreased below the pre-operative levels. Thus, trigeminocardiac reflex can occur as early as the skin incision even in a retrosigmoid approach due to stimulation of the mandibular division, when specific risk factors exist. Such episodes may serve as early warning signs for subsequent intraoperative occurrences. Brainstem compression can be a possible etiology of hypertension in young patients.

To demonstrate the utility of our multi-modal neurophysiology and neuroimaging integration approach in the pre-surgical evaluation, we present a proof-of-concept for using this approach in a patient with non-lesional frontal lobe epilepsy who underwent two resective surgeries to achieve seizure control. We conducted a post-hoc investigation using four neuroimaging and neurophysiology modalities: diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI), and stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) at rest and during seizures. We computed region-of-interest-based connectivity for each modality and applied betweenness centrality to identify key network hubs across modalities. Our results revealed that despite seizure semiology and sEEG indicating dysfunction in the right orbitofrontal region, the maximum overlap on the hubs across modalities extended to right temporal areas. Notably, the right middle temporal lobe region served as an overlap hub across DTI, rsfMRI, and rest sEEG networks and was only included in the resected area in the second surgery, which led to long-term seizure control of this patient. Our findings demonstrated that trans-modal hubs could help identify key areas related to epileptogenic network. Therefore, this case presents a promising perspective of using a multi-modal approach to improve the pre-surgical evaluation of patients with epilepsy.<p>',\n",

       " '<p>Chronic cough in children and adolescents can be troublesome both to the patient and the whole family. The most common causes of chronic cough in children are protracted bacterial bronchitis and bronchial asthma. However, differential diagnostic workup and treatment can become complicated when a cough of different etiology is encountered, especially in a child having a complex medical history for an unrelated pathology. A cough lacking any identified somatic cause and response to medical treatment in combination with core clinical features of tics that include suppressibility, distractibility, suggestibility, variability, and the presence of a premonitory sensation is labeled tic cough. Here we discuss a case of an adolescent who had atrophy of the corpus callosum and a history of ventriculoperitoneal shunting due to hydrocephalus caused by stenosis of the sylvian aqueduct, but now presented with a debilitating dry cough lasting for several months. After physical causes of cough were ruled out, the diagnosis of tic cough was reached, and multidisciplinary treatment ensured complete recovery. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case showing coincidence of tic cough and hydrocephalus. The co-occurrence of non-syndromic corpus callosum atrophy and tic cough might hypothetically suggest a predisposing pathogenetic link via reduced signaling through cortical inhibitory neurons; further studies are needed. The importance of careful assessment of medical history, clinical picture, and features of the cough itself are emphasized in order to reach the correct diagnosis. Increased awareness of medical society is mandatory to recognize tic cough and to distinguish it from the neurologic manifestations of organic brain pathology.<p>',\n",

Initially, a diagnosis of atypical motor neuron disease (MND) was made. At re-evaluation 11 years later, upper limb wasting and weakness had further progressed and were accompanied by sensorineural hearing loss. MRI of the brain and spine demonstrated extensive supra- and infratentorial SS (including the surface of the whole spinal cord) as well as a ventral longitudinal intraspinal fluid collection (VLISFC) extending along almost the entire thoracic spine. Osteodegenerative changes were observed at C5-C7 level, with osteophytes protruding posteriorly. The bony spurs at C6-C7 level were hypothesized to have lesioned the dura, causing a CSF leak and thus a VLISFC. Review of the MRI acquired at first evaluation showed that the VLISFC was already present at that time (actually beginning at C7 level), whereas the SS was not. 19 years after the onset of upper limb weakness, the patient additionally developed parkinsonism.

When examining patient with increased T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintensities in the temporal polar white matter, autoimmune encephalitis, including PNS, should be considered. Herein, we report the case of an 85-year-old man with carcinomatous meningitis due to lung large cell carcinoma. He showed disturbance of consciousness, abnormal behavior, incomprehensible speech, and apathy, which suggested brain dysfunction. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed high intensities on the whole cerebellum on a diffusion-weighted image and bilateral T2 FLAIR hyperintensities in the temporal polar white matter. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis and cytology showed elevated total protein levels, pleocytosis, and atypical cells with nuclear enlargement, hyperchromasia, and irregular shape. Autopsy revealed lung large cell carcinoma and its brain metastasis. Tumor cells were disseminated to the central nervous system along the subarachnoid space. Furthermore, plenty of carcinoma cells and peritumoral enlarged perivascular space were observed in the temporal poles. To our knowledge, this is the first report of bilateral T2 FLAIR hyperintensities in the temporal polar white matter caused by carcinomatous meningitis with pathological confirmation.

In a contrast-enhanced whole-body computed tomography examination, the appearance of intra-axial brain lesions suspicious for metastases was documented. The subsequent contrast-enhanced brain magnetic resonance imaging showed the presence of 5 intra-axial lesions consistent with brain metastases. These lesions exhibited hyperintense signals in T2-fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images; after contrast agent administration, a ring-like contrast-enhancement was more clearly visible in T1-weighted images acquired later (about 15 minutes after contrast agent administration) than in those acquired earlier (about 5-7 minutes after contrast agent administration). In conclusion, for oncological subjects with multiple brain lesions lacking obvious contrast-enhancement using a standard magnetic resonance imaging protocol, we suggest acquiring late images.

We report the first Japanese case of LHON with the m.13051â\\x80\\x89G>A pathogenic variant, which is a rare primary pathogenic variant of LHON. A 24-year-old woman developed subacute visual loss in both eyes over several months. The best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 6/120 in her right eye (OD) and 6/7.5 in her left eye (OS). A relative afferent pupillary defect was not detected. Humphrey visual field testing revealed a central scotoma OD and a temporal paracentral scotoma OS. Fundus examination showed the presence of a pale optic disc OD and optic disc swelling with peripapillary microangiopathy OS. Orbital magnetic resonance imaging showed no abnormal findings. As the mitochondrial DNA gene testing demonstrated the m.13051â\\x80\\x89G>A pathogenic variant, the patient was diagnosed with LHON. Subsequently, her BCVA worsened to 6/600 in each eye, followed by a nearly plateau-like progression thereafter.

We examined the case of a WD patient who developed a low thoracic dorsal myelopathy due to chronic hypocupremia from excessive zinc therapy. A comprehensive literature review was conducted to identify similar cases. Ten additional cases of neurological pathology resulting from copper deficiency in the context of WD over-treatment were identified, all occurring during therapy with zinc salts. Myelopathy and peripheral neuropathy were the most common complications, while two additional groups reported leukoencephalopathy. Early cytopenia was often associated with copper deficiency-related neurological pathology appearing early in the context of copper deficiency. WD patients undergoing treatment, especially with zinc salts, should be closely monitored to prevent over-treatment and the consequent copper deficiency. Regular complete blood counts could provide early detection of copper deficiency, avoiding irreversible neurological damage. Swift recognition of new neurological signs not consistent with WD and timely discontinuation of the decoppering therapy are critical for improving outcomes. The optimal management, including the potential benefit of copper supplementation in patients with WD and subsequent therapy adjustments, remains unclear and necessitates further investigation.

       " '<p>Connectivity studies with nuclear medicine systems are scarce in literature. They mainly employ PET imaging and group level analyses due to the low temporal resolution of PET and especially SPECT imaging. Our current study analyses connectivity at an individual level using dynamic SPECT imaging, which has been enabled by the improved temporal resolution performances provided by the 360Â°CZT cameras. We present the case of an 80-year-old man referred for brain perfusion SPECT imaging for cognitive disorders for whom a dynamic SPECT acquisition was performed utilizing a 360Â°CZT camera (temporal sampling of 15 frames Ã\\x97 3 s, 10 frames Ã\\x97 15 s, 14 frames Ã\\x97 30 s), followed by a conventional static acquisition of 15 m. Functional SPECT connectivity (fSPECT) was assessed through a seed correlation analysis and 5 well-known resting-state networks were identified: the executive, the default mode, the sensory motor, the salience, and the visual networks. This case report supports the feasibility of fSPECT imaging to identify well known resting-state networks, thanks to the novel properties of a 360Â°CZT camera, and opens the way to the development of more dedicated functional connectivity studies using brain perfusion SPECT imaging.<p>',\n",

Subsequently, the patient developed symptoms consistent with Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome (GBS), which was supported by nerve conduction studies (NCV) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. Throughout the course of the disease, the patient experienced abdominal pain and abnormal liver function. After a comprehensive evaluation, we determined that the abnormal liver function was a result of hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection, which may have acted as a trigger for GBS. The patient was treated with corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin and Rituximab, resulting in symptom relief and clinical improvement after therapy and follow-up. This case highlights the potential responsiveness and reversibility of CCPD.

Ischemic lesions can result in permanent neurological deficits, and a residual aneurysm can lead to the recurrence of the aneurysm in 2% of cases. In this article, we present five cases (two cases of ruptured aneurysms, two cases of non-ruptured aneurysms, and a case of arteriovenous malformation) in which we reduced the aforementioned risks with the use of intraoperative neuromonitoring and angiography. Intraoperative neuromonitoring (IONM) is used to measure motor and sensory-evoked potentials to detect brain hypoperfusion. Intraoperative angiography with the dye indocyanine green (ICG-A), which fluoresces in a vessel under a microscope after intravenous administration, helps to identify residual aneurysm sacs and distal blood flow. With the use of IONM and ICG-A, we identified abnormalities and adjusted our interventions and treatments. IONM and ICG-A can lead to a better outcome after surgical treatment of cerebral vascular abnormalities.<p>',\n",

For any samples that underwent histopathological examination, the first results were not informative; the second and the third results revealed hemangioendothelioma (HE); and the fourth results led to the IPEH diagnosis. Interferon alpha (IFN-Î±) and subsequently sirolimus were prescribed. Both were well tolerated. Clinical and radiological features remained stable 43 months after starting sirolimus therapy and 132 months after the first diagnosis. To date, 45 cases of intracranial IPEH have been reported, mostly as single lesions without parenchymal location. They are usually treated by surgery and sometimes by radiotherapy upon recurrence. Our case is notable for two main reasons: because of the consecutive recurrent multifocal exclusively cerebral lesions and the therapeutic approach we used. Based on multifocal brain recurrence and good performance, we propose pharmacological therapy, including IFN-Î± and sirolimus, to stabilize IPEH.<p>\",\n",

Although tumors and hemorrhagic diseases are the common causes, some rarer etiologies, such as vascular malformations, might also present with intracranial mass lesion manifestations. Such lesions are easily misdiagnosed due to the lack of manifestations of the primary disease. The treatment involves a detailed examination and differential diagnosis of the etiology and clinical manifestations. On 26 October 2022, a patient with craniocervical junction arteriovenous fistulas (CCJAVFs) was admitted to Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital. Imaging examinations showed a brainstem mass lesion, and the patient was initially diagnosed with a brainstem tumor. After a thorough preoperative discussion and a digital subtraction angiography (DSA) examination, the patient was diagnosed with CCJAVF. The patient was cured using interventional treatment, and an invasive craniotomy was not required. During diagnosis and treatment, the cause of the disease might not be apparent. Thus, a comprehensive preoperative examination is very important, and physicians need to conduct the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of the etiology based on the examination to administer precise treatment and reduce unnecessary operations.<p>',\n",

This article presents the case of a 20-year-old cis-gender male with intermittent fever, bilateral uveitis, and neurological symptoms who was found to have multiple brain stem mass lesions on brain imaging. A careful medical history elicited recurrent painful oral and genital ulcerations which were important in making the correct diagnosis. As there are no validated criteria or definite set of tests available to confirm neuro-BehÃ§et's disease, the diagnosis is often established by exclusion after ruling out other potential etiologies. In our case, after an extensive negative workup for infectious, neuro-degenerative and malignant etiologies combined with the patient's medical history, a diagnosis of BehÃ§et's disease with neurological involvement (neuro-BehÃ§et's syndrome) was made. High doses of steroids were given, and the patient had a favorable outcome. Repeated magnetic resonance imaging of the brain 2 years later showed no new brain lesions. Neuro-BehÃ§et's disease should be included as a differential diagnosis of unexplained brain stem lesions in the right clinical context. In these situations, providers should obtain medical histories related to genital and oral ulcers and eye problems as these may help to narrow down the diagnosis. The clinical presentation and challenges of this uncommon presentation of BD including a brief literature review of neuro-BehÃ§et's disease with brain stem mass lesions are discussed in this case study.<p>\",\n",

       " '<h>Introduction:<h><p>An arteriovenous malformation (AVM) consists of a tangled cluster of dilated blood vessels forming anomalous communication between arterial and venous systems without capillary bridging. The most likely manifestations of a ruptured AVM are intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), or intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH). Subdural hematoma (SDH) is exceptional in cases of ruptured brain arteriovenous malformation (BAVM).<p><h>Case Report:<h><p>A 30-year-old female was referred to the Emergency Room with a major complaint of sudden thunderclap headache 1 day before admission. The patient also complained of double vision and left ptosis that lasted for 1 day. There was no other complaint or history of hypertension, diabetes, or trauma. Non-contrast head computed tomography (CT) showed ICH-SAH-SDH on the left side of the brain which was not typical of a hypertensive pattern. The secondary ICH has a score of 6, indicating that 100% of the bleeding might be caused by underlying vascular malformation. Furthermore, cerebral angiography showed cortical plexiform BAVM on the left occipital lobe, and the patient underwent curative embolization.<p><h>Discussion:<h><p>Spontaneous SDH is very rare, and there are some hypotheses about the reasons for its occurrence. First, brain movement stretches the arachnoid layer that adheres to the AVM, resulting in direct bleeding into subdural space. Second, high-flow pia-arachnoid ruptured blood might extravasate into subdural space. Finally, the ruptured cortical artery that connects the cortex and dura layer (bridging artery) might also cause SDH. Some scoring systems are useful in BAVM, and this study selected endovascular embolization for the patient.<p><h>Conclusion:<h><p>Brain AVM rupture usually causes ICH, SAH, or IVH. Clinicians must be more aware of spontaneous SDH because it might be caused by a vascular malformation, although it is rare.<p>',\n",

During pelvic lymph node dissection, she developed an obturator nerve injury. She underwent nerve grafting during the same surgery by the microsurgeon. Donor nerve was the ipsilateral sural nerve with a 3-cm graft length. Due to obturator nerve palsy, postoperative manual muscle test results were as follows: adductor magnus muscle, 1; pectineus muscle, 1; adductor longs muscle, 0; adductor brevis muscle, 0; and gracilis muscle, 0.

We performed an awake craniotomy (AC) that mapped the standard motor and speech areas, while the patient played guitar intraoperatively and sang. Outcomes were remarkable with preservation of function and noted improvements in his musical abilities in outpatient follow-up. In addition, we performed a review of the literature in which awake craniotomies were performed for the removal of brain tumors in patients with some background in music (e.g., score reading, humming/singing). To date, only 4 patients have played a musical instrument intraoperatively during an AC for brain tumor resection. Using awake cortical mapping techniques and paradigms for preserving speech function during an intraoperative musical performance with singing is feasible and can yield a great result for patients. The use of standard brain mapping over music processing mapping did not yield a negative outcome.

The following case report highlights some of these vital concepts associated with radial artery access, including appropriate patient selection as well as assessment of arterial size in the context of neurointerventional techniques. Early identification of complications such as arterial injury and compartment syndrome, with an emphasis on appropriate draping and inter-procedure monitoring, is discussed as well as approaches for subsequent management.

While HP is usually treated with systemic immunotherapies, response to therapy is variable and may be limited by insufficient drug concentrations in the brain. We report on a 57-year-old patient with HP manifesting with vision and hearing loss who had sustained clinical progression despite various systemic immunotherapies. Intraventricular chemotherapy with methotrexate, cytarabine, and dexamethasone was initiated. We present clinical, imaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings, including cytokine levels before and after intraventricular treatment: rapid decrease of cell count, lactate and profibrotic cytokine levels in the CSF following intraventricular chemotherapy was paralleled by a mild reduction of dura thickness in MRI. The already severely impaired visual acuity and hearing loss did not progress further. Treatment was complicated by exacerbation of previously subtle psychiatric symptoms. Follow-up was terminated after 6 months as the patient suffered from a fatal ischemic stroke. Autopsy revealed neurosarcoidosis as the underlying cause of HP.

       " \"<p>A 2-year-old girl started to wobble without any specific triggers, so the patient was admitted to our hospital's pediatric department. The entire cerebellum showed severe atrophy on MRI and much lower uptake than that in the cerebral cortex on perfusion SPECT. The diagnosis of opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome (OMS) was suspected. MRI visualized a small mass behind the inferior vena cava. Although its uptake on I-123 MIBG scintigraphy was inconclusive, the mass was surgically removed, and the diagnosis of neuroblastoma was pathologically confirmed. OMS is one of the paraneoplastic neurological syndromes with cerebellar ataxia, myoclonus of the trunk and extremities, and opsoclonus as its main symptoms. Approximately 50% of children cases with OMS are associated with neuroblastoma. The prognosis for neuroblastoma itself with OMS is relatively good, but the neurological prognosis is very poor.

       " '<p>Peripheral nerve injuries (PNIs) that consist of simple nerve severance often result in severe motor impairment and permanent loss of function. Such patients face significant costs and pose major burdens to healthcare systems. Currently, the most promising surgical technique to achieve the best clinical outcome after such PNIs is immediate primary coaptation of severed nerve ends by microsutures (neurorrhaphy). However, recovery is often poor and delayed for many months due to Wallerian degeneration (WD) and slow (1â\\x80\\x932 mm/day) axonal outgrowths from severed proximal axons that may not properly reinnervate denervated afferent/efferent targets that have atrophied. In contrast, recent pre-clinical studies using polyethylene glycol (PEG) to facilitate primary nerve repair have greatly improved the rate and extent of sensory and motor recovery and prevented much WD and muscle atrophy. That is, PEG-fused axons rapidly establish proximalâ\\x80\\x93distal axoplasmic/axolemmal continuity, which do not undergo WD and maintain the structure and function of neuromuscular junction (NMJ). PEG-fused axons rapidly reinnervate denervated NMJs, thereby preventing muscle atrophy associated with monthslong denervation due to slowly regenerating axonal outgrowths. We now describe PEG-mediated fusion repair of a digital nerve in each of two patients presenting with a digital laceration resulting in total loss of sensation. The first patientâ\\x80\\x99s tactile perception improved markedly at 3 days postoperatively (PO). Two-point discrimination improved from greater than 10 mm at initial presentation to 4 mm at 11-week PO, and the Semmesâ\\x80\\x93Weinstein monofilament score improved from greater than 6.65 to 2.83 mm, a near-normal level.

The sensory function then improved for 4 months PO, with both two-point discrimination and Semmesâ\\x80\\x93Weinstein scores approaching near-normal levels at the final follow-up. These case study data are consistent with data from animal models. All these data suggest that PEG-fusion technologies could produce a paradigm shift from the current clinical practice of waiting days to months to repair ablation PNIs with autografts, anucleated nerve allografts, or conduits in which the patient outcome is solely dependent upon axon regeneration over months or years.<p>',\n",

The patient tried multiple antiseizure medications including valproic acid, topiramate, phenytoin, carbamazepine, levetiracetam, brivaracetam, and lamotrigine without success. He was eventually put on a combination of lacosamide, zonisamide, clonazepam, and primidone, which helped to a certain extent, but the patient continued to have daily episodes and 10â\\x80\\x9312 electroclinical seizures noted on a follow-up 24-hour ambulatory EEG. Follow-up brain MRI with contrast confirmed the diagnosis. Phase II intracranial monitoring for surgical management was offered to the patient, which he deferred because of risks. Vagal nerve stimulator (VNS) was also offered as a palliative therapy to which the patient agreed. Gradual titration in VNS settings over 1 year helped to achieve seizure freedom. Presentation of focal seizure with this type of atypical etiology is rare. Typically, surgical management is used to achieve seizure freedom in this condition; successful management with VNS has not been reported so often.<p>',\n",

While recent meta-analyses have demonstrated generalized EEG slowing with the emergence of delta rhythms in patients hospitalized for severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, no EEG study or dopamine transporter scintigraphy (DaTSCAN) has been performed in patients with long COVID presenting with apathy. The objective of this case report was to explore the pathophysiology of neuropsychological symptoms in long COVID.<p><h>Case Presentation<h><p>A 47-year-old patient who developed a long COVID with prominent apathy following an initially clinically mild SARS-CoV-2 infection underwent neuropsychological assessment, cerebral MRI, DaTSCAN, and resting-state high-density EEG 7 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The EEG data were compared to those of 21 healthy participants. The patient presented with apathy, cognitive difficulties with dysexecutive syndrome, moderate attentional and verbal episodic memory disturbances, and resolution of premorbid mild gaming disorder, mild mood disturbances, and sleep disturbances. His MRI and DaTSCAN were unremarkable. EEG revealed a complex pattern of oscillatory abnormalities compared to the control group, with a strong increase in whole-scalp delta and beta band activity, as well as a decrease in alpha band activity. Overall, these effects were more prominent in the frontal-central-temporal region.<p><h>Conclusion<h><p>These results suggest widespread changes in EEG oscillatory patterns in a patient with long COVID characterized by neuropsychological complications with prominent apathy. Despite the inherent limitations of a case report, these results suggest dysfunction in the cortical networks involved in motivation and emotion.<p>',\n",

Maternally inherited mutations in the MT-TL1 gene are the most frequent causes for this disorder. Clinical manifestations may include stroke-like episodes, epilepsy, dementia, headache and myopathy. Among these, acute visual failure, usually in association with cortical blindness, can occur because of stroke-like episodes affecting the occipital cortex or the visual pathways. Vision loss due to optic neuropathy is otherwise considered a typical manifestation of other mitochondrial diseases such as Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON).<p><h>Case presentation<h><p>Here we describe a 55-year-old woman, sister of a previously described patient with MELAS harbouring the m.3243Aâ\\x80\\x89>â\\x80\\x89G (p.0, MT-TL1) mutation, with otherwise unremarkable medical history, that presented with subacute, painful visual impairment of one eye, accompanied by proximal muscular pain and headache. Over the next weeks, she developed severe and progressive vision loss limited to one eye. Ocular examination confirmed unilateral swelling of the optic nerve head; fluorescein angiography showed segmental perfusion delay in the optic disc and papillary leakage. Neuroimaging, blood and CSF examination and temporal artery biopsy ruled out neuroinflammatory disorders and giant cell arteritis (GCA). Mitochondrial sequencing analysis confirmed the m.3243Aâ\\x80\\x89>â\\x80\\x89G transition, and excluded the three most common LHON mutations, as well as the m.3376Gâ\\x80\\x89>â\\x80\\x89A LHON/MELAS overlap syndrome mutation. Based on the constellation of clinical symptoms and signs presented in our patient, including the muscular involvement, and the results of the investigations, the diagnosis of optic neuropathy as a stroke-like event affecting the optic disc was performed. L-arginine and ubidecarenone therapies were started with the aim to improve stroke-like episode symptoms and prevention. The visual defect remained stable with no further progression or outbreak of new symptoms.<p><h>Conclusions<h><p>Atypical clinical presentations must be always considered in mitochondrial disorders, even in well-described phenotypes and when mutational load in peripheral tissue is low.

NIID is pathologically characterized by ubiquitin and p-62 positive intranuclear eosinophilic inclusions that affect multiple organ systems, including the brain, skin, and other tissues. Although the diagnosis of NIID is challenging due to phenotypic heterogeneity, a greater understanding of the clinical and imaging presentations can improve accurate and early diagnosis. Here, we present three cases of pathologically proven adult-onset NIID, all presenting with episodes of acute encephalopathy with protracted workups and lengthy time between symptom onset and diagnosis. Case 1 highlights challenges in the diagnosis of NIID when MRI does not reveal classic abnormalities and provides a striking example of hyperperfusion in the setting of acute encephalopathy, as well as unique pathology with neuronal central chromatolysis, which has not been previously described.

Although left hemiplegic due to cerebral hemorrhage and impaired consciousness due to cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) appeared postoperatively, anticoagulant therapy quickly improved CVST and impaired consciousness. However, various unexplained symptoms such as insomnia, hallucination, impulsivity, impaired consciousness, and a new type of drug-resistant cluster seizures gradually developed over a 2-month period. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed the gradual extension of a hyperintense area from the right frontal lobe on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images. Intravenous methylprednisolone pulse was initiated from postoperative day (POD) 74, followed by intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) therapy, although white blood cell counts were normal in all three cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examinations.

       " \"<p>Myxoma is the most common type of benign cardiac tumor in adults, and it has a strong tendency to embolize or metastasize to distant organs. Patients with multiple brain metastases have rarely been seen in clinics; hence, standard treatment protocols for multimyxoma metastasis in the brain have not been established. We present the case of a 47-year-old female who had convulsions in the right hand and repeated seizures. Computed tomography revealed multiple tumor sites in her brain. Craniotomy was conducted to remove the tumor sites. However, recurrent brain tumors and unexpected cerebral infarctions occurred frequently shortly after the treatment because the cardiac myxoma had not been treated due to the patient's personal concerns. The myxoma was resected by gamma knife radiosurgery, and temozolomide was given prior to cardiac surgery. There has been no evidence of tumor recurrence from the 2 years following the surgery until the present. This case highlights the importance of prioritizing cardiac lesions over cerebral lesions; if a cerebral metastasis has been found, it is likely that the cardiac myxoma is already unstable, with high rates of spread and metastasis. Therefore, it is unwise to treat metastasis sites before the cardiac myxoma. Additionally, the case suggests that gamma knife radiosurgery combined with temozolomide is effective as treatment for multiple myxoma metastasis in the brain. Compared with conventional cerebral surgery, gamma knife radiosurgery is safer, causes less bleeding, and requires a shorter time for recovery.<p>\",\n",

We report a previously undescribed concurrence of hyperthyroid-associated exercise-induced myalgia and stiffness, pyramidal tract dysfunction, and myoclonic movements that make an initial clinical diagnosis difficult. Case presentation: A 17-year-old male was hospitalized in the department of neurology, presenting with a 4-year history of severe exercise-induced myalgia and stiffness, weakness of lower limbs, and myoclonic movements. Laboratory investigations unexpectedly revealed hyperthyroidism. MRI of the brain and spine, electrophysiology, and whole exome sequencing were also performed. Antithyroid therapy led to marked improvement of neurologic symptoms, accompanied by a significant improvement of the time-dependent decline in compound muscle action potentials (CMAP) amplitudes after exercise and normalization of the prolonged QTc interval. Genetic analysis identified a rare variant in SCN5A. Conclusion: This case report provides important insights into the relationship between hyperthyroidism and neurologic/cardiac complications, particularly in those with a genetic predisposition.

       " '<p>The withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies is frequently considered for pediatric patients with severe acute brain injuries who are admitted to the intensive care unit. However, it is worth noting that some children with a resultant poor neurological status may ultimately survive and achieve a positive neurological outcome. Evidence suggests that adults with hidden consciousness may have a more favorable prognosis compared to those without it. Currently, no treatable network disorders have been identified in cases of severe acute brain injury, aside from seizures detectable through an electroencephalogram (EEG) and neurostimulation via amantadine. In this report, we present three cases in which multimodal brain network evaluation played a helpful role in patient care. This evaluation encompassed various assessments such as continuous video EEG, visual-evoked potentials, somatosensory-evoked potentials, auditory brainstem-evoked responses, resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI), and passive-based and command-based task-based fMRI. It is worth noting that the latter three evaluations are unique as they have not yet been established as part of the standard care protocol for assessing acute brain injuries in children with suppressed consciousness. The first patient underwent serial fMRIs after experiencing a coma induced by trauma. Subsequently, the patient displayed improvement following the administration of antiseizure medication to address abnormal signals. In the second case, a multimodal brain network evaluation uncovered covert consciousness, a previously undetected condition in a pediatric patient with acute brain injury. In both patients, this discovery potentially influenced decisions concerning the withdrawal of life support.

Notably, this patient underwent the first fMRI prior to experiencing brain death as a pediatric patient.

Childhood and late-onset MTP deficiency is characterized by myopathy/rhabdomyolysis and peripheral neuropathy; however, the features are unclear. A 44-year-old woman was clinically diagnosed with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease at 3 years of age due to gait disturbance. Her activity and voluntary speech gradually decreased in her 40s. Cognitive function was evaluated and brain imaging tests were performed. The Mini-Mental State Examination and frontal assessment battery scores were 25/30 and 10/18, respectively, suggesting higher brain dysfunction. Peripheral nerve conduction studies revealed axonal impairments. Brain computed tomography showed significant calcification. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an increased gadolinium contrast-enhanced signal in the white matter, suggesting demyelination of the central nervous system (CNS) due to LCFAs. The diagnosis of MTP deficiency was confirmed through genetic examination. Administration of L-carnitine and a medium-chain fatty triglyceride diet was initiated, and the progression of higher brain dysfunction was retarded within 1 year. This patient's presentation was suggestive of CNS demyelination.

Accordingly, Parkinsonâ\\x80\\x99s disease (PD), a disease defined by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the STN, has an interesting, although unspecified, relationship to hiccups. Hiccups have been described in association with PD and the use of dopaminergic medications.

There have been sporadic reports of hiccups occurring in conjunction with STN-DBS. We present a case of hiccups occurring after STN-DBS for PD in a 65-year-old man.

       " '<p>Background: Subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) is widely used for the treatment of primary motor symptoms in patients with Parkinsonâ\\x80\\x99s disease (PD). Further, recent evidence suggests that STN-DBS may relieve a few ophthalmic symptoms in PD, such as eye-blink rate and the flexibility of eye saccades. However, its exact effect on visual function remains unknown. Herein, we report the case of a patient with PD who underwent STN-DBS and experienced visual symptoms following levodopa reduction. Case presentation: A 63-year-old male patient with PD developed severe visual impairment after six months of high-frequency STN-DBS. His symptoms resolved after adjusting the levodopa dose prescribed to the patient. Conclusions: This case report suggests that DBS is beneficial in patients with PD in terms of eye-blink rate. However, the rapid reduction of medication after STN-DBS may lead to retinal atrophy and the shrinkage of vessel density in the ocular fundus. Thus, neurosurgeons should pay close attention to patients with visual symptoms when adjusting levodopa dosages.<p>',\n",

A nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 returned positive. The patient had not received specific treatment for COVID-19 infection. Neurological examination disclosed symmetric weakness (Medical Research Council grade upper limbs 4/5, lowers limbs 2/5) and areflexia in both the legs and feet. No cranial nerves were involved. Following a neuro-electro-physiology study to evaluate neurological symptoms, AMSAN was suggested. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed elevated protein levels that confirmed the diagnosis of GBS. The patient was subsequently treated with intravenous immune globulin (IVIG), which improved her neurological symptoms (upper limbs 4/5, lowers limbs 4/5). However, urinary retention, dysarthria, dysphagia, bilateral facial paralysis, facial diplegia, bucking, and motor alalia gradually appeared, followed by aggravated paralysis (upper limbs 3/5, lowers limbs 1/5). After being hospitalized for 16â\\x80\\x89days, the patient underwent continuous plasma exchange (PE) treatment for a duration of 3â\\x80\\x89days. Following treatment, the patientâ\\x80\\x99s neurological symptoms and paralysis gradually improved (upper limbs 4/5, lowers limbs 4/5) over 2â\\x80\\x89weeks. Meanwhile, we observed that the patientâ\\x80\\x99s cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings dynamically evolved along with the fluctuation of her GBS symptoms, mainly in terms of the changes in T2 hyperintensity in the right thalamus accompanied by microhaemorrhages. The inflammation index was normal. We considered a wide range of possible causes including hypoxia, drugs, toxins, and metabolic derangements but these were excluded.<p><h>Conclusion<h><p>The AMSAN variant of GBS secondary to COVID-19 infection is severe and can cause extensive damage to the peripheral nerves system. The deterioration of symptoms in the patient after early immunotherapy may indicate treatment-related fluctuation (TRF) and could be attributed to immune rebound. Moreover, an excessive immune response post-COVID-19 infection may trigger concurrent damage to the central nervous system, indicating secondary harm to brain small blood vessels and nerve units. For suspected cases of GBS complicated by COVID-19, it is essential to conduct early brain MRI examinations in addition to routine peripheral nervous system evaluations to promptly detect any intracranial lesions. This facilitates appropriate immunotherapy and improves patient prognosis.<p>',\n",

Among its etiologies, nonarteritic PION is one of the most common causes. Studies on cases of PION associated with herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO) are limited, and the diagnosis was made based on the appearance of visual symptoms shortly following rashes. We describe a 64-year-old Asian woman with sudden painless visual loss in the upper half visual field of the left eye 6 weeks after ipsilateral HZO. Within a week, her left vision progressed to total visual loss. Initial examination revealed a near-total visual defect and a normal appearance of the optic disc in the left eye. Laboratory and imaging studies excluded the compressive, infiltrative, or inflammatory etiologies of the left optic nerve. Considering the temporal relationship between the skin rash and visual loss, HZO was the most likely cause of the nonarteritic PION. The patient was given a short course of oral valaciclovir and aspirin. At 6 weeks after the visual loss, an examination revealed stationary visual acuity and visual field defect in the left eye with a pale optic disc, and a retinal nerve fiber loss in the left eye.

Despite responding to steroid and azathioprine therapy, she experienced moon face and weight gain and desired the prompt reduction of the steroid dosage. She also wanted to conceive a child with a safe and preferably early pregnancy and parturition. Because pregnancy and parturition after the onset of NMOSD elevate the risk of relapse and miscarriage, treatment with satralizumab was initiated with the patient's consent.

Her symptoms appeared at 12-years-old and her visual acuity had since deteriorated from 0.6 to 0.2 bilaterally with decreased critical flicker frequency and bilateral central scotomas. She did not have a relative afferent pupillary defect. Fundoscopy revealed no distinct disc hyperaemia, atrophy, or peripapillary telangiectatic vessels. The retinal nerve fibre layer appeared normal on optical coherence tomography in each eye; however, loss of the interdigitation zone and the disruption of the ellipsoid zone at the fovea were observed in both eyes. Multifocal electroretinography revealed decreased amplitudes at both macula regions. Mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid analysis identified an m.14502T>C mutation, one of the primary mutations causing Leberâ\\x80\\x99s hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON). Despite the presence of a marked LHON mutation, however, she was clinically diagnosed as having an occult macular dystrophy. There have only been five previous case reports, all of which were sporadic, which detail the clinical characteristics of the m.14502T>C mutation. The m.14502T>C phenotype is somewhat consistent with that of the other major mutations, including young onset, bilateral progressive visual impairment, and a typical LHON fundus. Nevertheless, m.14502T>C alone has an extremely low penetrance and its phenotype may be minimal or subclinical, as seen in our case. Since little is known about the clinical course of the m.14502T>C mutation it may be possible that the LHON phenotype may appear in later stages of life. Moreover, m.14502T>C may function as a modifier gene, which alters the phenotype of other coexisting major LHON mutations, including penetrance and the severity of the disease, through synergistic effects.<p>',\n",

We discuss the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms to raise awareness of such cases and aid the development of effective interventions. Patient 1 suffered a TBI at 18 years of age, 2 years after which he presented repeated episodes of sexually deviant behavior (voyeurism). At 28, he committed suicide, since he was unable to control his aberrant behavior. Patient 2 suffered a TBI at the age of 13. He first displayed problematic behavior 7 years later, which included drinking excessive amounts of alcohol and stealing while inebriated. Despite both patients having sound moral judgment, they had irrational and uncontrollable impulses of desire. Imaging findings could explain the possible causes of impulse control impairments. Damage to the basal ganglia and limbic system, which are involved in social behavior, presumably led to desire-dominated behavior, leading to the patients conducting unlawful acts despite intact moral judgment. It is crucial to educate society about the prevalence of these disorders, explain how these disinhibitions start, and develop effective interventions.<p>',\n",

The consensus on treatment for both symptoms is yet to be standardized. This study reports the case of a 57-year-old male patient with left orbital trauma who developed PTNP immediately after the injury and secondary hemifacial dystonia 7 months thereafter. To treat his neuropathic pain, we performed peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) using a percutaneously implanted electrode to the ipsilateral supraorbital notch along the brow arch, which instantly resolved the patient's pain and dystonia. PTNP was relieved in a satisfactory manner until 18 months after the surgery, despite a gradual recurrence of the dystonia since 6 months after the surgery. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of PNS used for the treatment of PTNP combined with dystonia. This case report highlights the potential benefits of PNS in relieving neuropathic pain and dystonia and discusses the underlying therapeutic mechanism. Moreover, this study suggests that secondary dystonia occurs due to the uncoordinated integration of afferent sensory and efferent motor information. The findings of the present study indicate that PNS should be considered for patients with PTNP following the failure of conservative treatment. Secondary hemifacial dystonia may benefit from PNS upon further research and long-term assessment.<p>\",\n",

Ten additional cases of neurological pathology resulting from copper deficiency in the context of WD over-treatment were identified, all occurring during therapy with zinc salts. Myelopathy and peripheral neuropathy were the most common complications, while two additional groups reported leukoencephalopathy. Early cytopenia was often associated with copper deficiency-related neurological pathology appearing early in the context of copper deficiency. WD patients undergoing treatment, especially with zinc salts, should be closely monitored to prevent over-treatment and the consequent copper deficiency. Regular complete blood counts could provide early detection of copper deficiency, avoiding irreversible neurological damage.

We present 3 cases of classical IgM paraproteinaemic neuropathy who developed glioblastoma in the course of their illness following treatment with chemoimmunotherapy (CIT). Due to the progressive symptomatic nature of their neuropathy, all 3 patients were treated with CIT. The patients presented with glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype at 9 months, 5 years, and 6 years following treatment completion. None of the patients had unequivocal evidence of known predisposing factors for glioblastoma. Both disorders are exceedingly rare and the chance of random association is less than one in a million. Potential common pathogenic mechanisms include the influence of paraproteins and circulating lymphoplasmacytic cells on blood-brain permeability and CNS immune micro-environment as well as raised circulating angiogenic cytokines such as vascular endothelial growth factor. In cases with anti-myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) antibodies, surface MAG on glial cells may act as a target releasing cells from growth inhibition.

The tES-generated electric field (EF) within the brain is considered as one of the most important factors for physiological effects. However, it is still unclear how brain lesions may influence EF distribution induced by tES. In this case study, we reported in vivo measurements of EF in one epilepsy participant with brain lesions during different tES montages. With the in vivo EF data measured by implanted stereo-electroencephalography (sEEG) electrodes, the simulation model was investigated and validated.

The formation mechanism of CSDH after surgery, especially in DBS surgery, and the effect of recovery, need to be explored. Methods: We present two cases, complicated with SDE after DBS surgery, serious dysfunction complications such as hemiplegia and aphasia occurred on the postoperative day 36 and 49 individually, and images showed CSDH. Fusion image showed the bilateral electrodes were significantly shifted. Then, they were performed to drill craniotomy with a closed system drainage.

Given the failure of less invasive approaches, a more complex surgery with the employment of a pedunculated flap of pectoralis major in order to cover the IPG was attempted. Nevertheless, the IPG removal was finally unavoidable, resulting in a rapid decline in clinical performance. This illustrative case suggests how, in patients with sustained stimulation who benefit from a good degree of autonomy, it may be useful to use invasive surgical techniques to resolve skin erosions and save the DBS system. In spite of everything, sometimes complete or partial removal of the implant still becomes unavoidable, but this can lead to a severe worsening of PD symptoms. Definitive removal of the system should therefore be considered only in cases of frank infection or after failure of all other approaches.<p>',\n",

After tumor removal, all cases were stable and suffered no further relapses, which revealed the potential paraneoplastic mechanism between cancer and NMOSD. One of our patient's serum AQP4-IgG was transiently slightly elevated even though AQP4 was highly expressed in tumor cells, which indicates that AQP4 is not the main pathogenic antibody but might be induced by other underlying pathogenic antibodyâ\\x80\\x93antigen reactions.<p>\",\n",

Previous studies found out that brain abnormalities were not rare in these patients. Medulla oblongata (MO) was commonly involved and usually located at dorsal part. Patients who diagnosed NMOSD with MO lesions were more likely to have dysphagia. Previous reports indicated that the symptoms and signs of NMOSD patients could be controlled after immunosuppressive therapy. This patient was a 49-year-old Asian woman presented with recurrent vomiting and diagnosed NMOSD with MO involvement. However, after immunotherapy in other hospital, she still suffered from dysphagia. She then came to our department and completed videofluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS) and high-resolution pharyngeal manometry (HRPM). Her UES was not opening with aspiration and the UES residue pressure was higher than normal range, we figured that she had cricopharyngeal (CP) dysfunction. Then the SLP gave her traditional treatment, including catheter balloon dilation. But she failed improvement after treatment for 2 weeks. Then the clinicians decided to inject botulinum toxin (BTX) into her CP muscles, which needed specific location and appropriate dosage. Her UES residue pressure decreased after three times BTX injection. During this time, her SLP adjusted the treatment strategies based on her VFSS and HRM results. Combined BTX injection with traditional treatment, she can now eat food orally without restrictions. This case report we presented can provide treatment strategies for similar patients with dysphagia.<p>',\n",

In addition, we summarized the clinical features of the previously reported six MOG-IgG-positive cases with cranial nerve involvement and discussed the underlying mechanisms of MOGAD involving cranial nerves. Cranial neuropathy is an emerging phenotype in MOGAD, which has characteristics of both central and peripheral nervous system (PNS) involvement, with the trigeminal nerve being the most commonly affected nerve. MOG antibody testing in patients with cranial neuropathies is warranted, and immunotherapy is advocated when the risk of relapse is high.

Three-dimensional time-of-flight MR angiography showed high flow in the right cavernous sinus, indicating a carotid cavernous fistula (CCF). In the arterial phase of digital subtraction angiography (DSA), a fistula in the right cavernous sinus was revealed which was fed by meningeal branches from both the external and internal carotid arteries, confirming an indirect CCF. The origin of the right ophthalmic artery was seen, but its branches were not detected. Right common carotid artery DSA showed a superior ophthalmic vein occlusion and the drainage vein of the CCF ran through the inferior petrosal sinus to the internal jugular vein. The right cavernous sinus was embolised using platinum coils and glue to occlude the feeding vessels from the branches of both the external and internal carotid arteries.

Patients often test positive for anti-AQP4 antibodies, while some have anti-MOG antibodies. Double seropositivity has been described, with a variable prevalence (0 to 26%) dependent on the testing method. The clinical significance of double seropositivity remains unclear. We present the case of a 65-year-old patient, admitted to our clinic with optical neuritis, followed up approximately 10 days later by cervical myelitis, who tested positive for both anti-AQP4 and anti-MOG antibodies. The clinical onset coincided with a mild form of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The neurological symptoms were initially relatively subdued, which delayed the diagnosis. The patient was not vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. The clinical picture was compatible with an anti-AQP4 phenotype. The patient was started on corticosteroid therapy, under which the clinical response was good. Our case reinforces the idea that SARS-CoV-2 can precipitate autoimmune demyelinating diseases since SARS-CoV-2 infection has already been demonstrated as a risk factor for NMOSD relapses. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of double seropositive neuromyelitis optica associated with COVID-19. We expect that in the near future, as the true burden of COVID becomes clearer, we shall encounter other cases which can trace their apparent clinical onset to a SARS-CoV-2 infection.

       " '<p>Peripheral nerve injuries (PNIs) that consist of simple nerve severance often result in severe motor impairment and permanent loss of function. Such patients face significant costs and pose major burdens to healthcare systems. Currently, the most promising surgical technique to achieve the best clinical outcome after such PNIs is immediate primary coaptation of severed nerve ends by microsutures (neurorrhaphy). However, recovery is often poor and delayed for many months due to Wallerian degeneration (WD) and slow (1â\\x80\\x932 mm/day) axonal outgrowths from severed proximal axons that may not properly reinnervate denervated afferent/efferent targets that have atrophied. In contrast, recent pre-clinical studies using polyethylene glycol (PEG) to facilitate primary nerve repair have greatly improved the rate and extent of sensory and motor recovery and prevented much WD and muscle atrophy. That is, PEG-fused axons rapidly establish proximalâ\\x80\\x93distal axoplasmic/axolemmal continuity, which do not undergo WD and maintain the structure and function of neuromuscular junction (NMJ). PEG-fused axons rapidly reinnervate denervated NMJs, thereby preventing muscle atrophy associated with monthslong denervation due to slowly regenerating axonal outgrowths. We now describe PEG-mediated fusion repair of a digital nerve in each of two patients presenting with a digital laceration resulting in total loss of sensation. The first patientâ\\x80\\x99s tactile perception improved markedly at 3 days postoperatively (PO). Two-point discrimination improved from greater than 10 mm at initial presentation to 4 mm at 11-week PO, and the Semmesâ\\x80\\x93Weinstein monofilament score improved from greater than 6.65 to 2.83 mm, a near-normal level.

The sensory function then improved for 4 months PO, with both two-point discrimination and Semmesâ\\x80\\x93Weinstein scores approaching near-normal levels at the final follow-up. These case study data are consistent with data from animal models. All these data suggest that PEG-fusion technologies could produce a paradigm shift from the current clinical practice of waiting days to months to repair ablation PNIs with autografts, anucleated nerve allografts, or conduits in which the patient outcome is solely dependent upon axon regeneration over months or years.<p>',\n",

Her serum was positive for AQP4-IgG and MRI brain and spine demonstrated areas of demyelination in the corpus callosum and thoracic spine. She was treated with high dose intravenous methylprednisolone and underwent plasmapheresis for five consecutive days, but continued to clinically deteriorate with ongoing blindness in her left eye (light perception only).

However, only individual cases have been reported assessing different degrees of hospitalization outcomes. Therefore, outpatient recovery profiles during rehabilitation interventions are needed to better understand neuroplasticity mechanisms required for upper limb motor recovery. Here, we report the progression of physiological and clinical outcomes during upper limb rehabilitation of a 41-year-old patient, without any stroke risk factors, which presented a stroke on the same day as being diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient, who presented hemiparesis with incomplete motor recovery after conventional treatment, participated in a clinical trial consisting of an experimental brain-computer interface (BCI) therapy focused on upper limb rehabilitation during the chronic stage of stroke. Clinical and physiological features were measured throughout the intervention, including the Fugl-Meyer Assessment for the Upper Extremity (FMA-UE), Action Research Arm Test (ARAT), the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), corticospinal excitability using transcranial magnetic stimulation, cortical activity with electroencephalography, and upper limb strength. After the intervention, the patient gained 8 points and 24 points of FMA-UE and ARAT, respectively, along with a reduction of one point of MAS. In addition, grip and pinch strength doubled. Corticospinal excitability of the affected hemisphere increased while it decreased in the unaffected hemisphere. Moreover, cortical activity became more pronounced in the affected hemisphere during movement intention of the paralyzed hand. Recovery was higher compared to that reported in other BCI interventions in stroke and was due to a reengagement of the primary motor cortex of the affected hemisphere during hand motor control. This suggests that patients with stroke related to COVID-19 may benefit from a BCI intervention and highlights the possibility of a significant recovery in these patients, even in the chronic stage of stroke.<p>',\n",

       " \"<p>Myxoma is the most common type of benign cardiac tumor in adults, and it has a strong tendency to embolize or metastasize to distant organs. Patients with multiple brain metastases have rarely been seen in clinics; hence, standard treatment protocols for multimyxoma metastasis in the brain have not been established. We present the case of a 47-year-old female who had convulsions in the right hand and repeated seizures. Computed tomography revealed multiple tumor sites in her brain. Craniotomy was conducted to remove the tumor sites. However, recurrent brain tumors and unexpected cerebral infarctions occurred frequently shortly after the treatment because the cardiac myxoma had not been treated due to the patient's personal concerns. The myxoma was resected by gamma knife radiosurgery, and temozolomide was given prior to cardiac surgery. There has been no evidence of tumor recurrence from the 2 years following the surgery until the present. This case highlights the importance of prioritizing cardiac lesions over cerebral lesions; if a cerebral metastasis has been found, it is likely that the cardiac myxoma is already unstable, with high rates of spread and metastasis. Therefore, it is unwise to treat metastasis sites before the cardiac myxoma. Additionally, the case suggests that gamma knife radiosurgery combined with temozolomide is effective as treatment for multiple myxoma metastasis in the brain. Compared with conventional cerebral surgery, gamma knife radiosurgery is safer, causes less bleeding, and requires a shorter time for recovery.<p>\",\n",

Then, we recruited five other hemiplegic stroke patients for rehabilitation training (6 days a week, lasting for 12â\\x80\\x9314 days) using the same BCI system to verify the effectiveness. The mean and Cohenâ\\x80\\x99s w were used to compare the changes in limb motor and brain functions before and after training. (3) Results: In the feasibility verification, the continuous motor state switching time (CMSST) of the three patients was 17.8 Â± 21.0s, and the motor state percentages (MSPs) in the upper and lower limb training were 52.6 Â± 25.7% and 72.4 Â± 24.0%, respectively. The effective training revolutions (ETRs) per minute were 25.8 Â± 13.0 for upper limb and 24.8 Â± 6.4 for lower limb. There were no adverse events during the training process. Compared with the baseline, the motor function indices of the five patients were improved, including sitting balance ability, upper limb Fugelâ\\x80\\x93Meyer assessment (FMA), lower limb FMA, 6 min walking distance, modified Barthel index, and root mean square (RMS) value of triceps surae, which increased by 0.4, 8.0, 5.4, 11.4, 7.0, and 0.9, respectively, and all had large effect sizes (Cohenâ\\x80\\x99s w â\\x89¥ 0.5).

The pathophysiology of IIH is not fully understood but is strongly linked to a reduced uptake of CSF into the central dural sinus veins. In this study, we examined the CSF flow rates in the SAS ON and the brain in patients with IIH and PE compared to healthy controls by applying non-invasive diffusion-weighted MRI. Knowing about the flow ratio of CSF may be of clinical relevance for the treatment decisions of IIH. If medical treatment fails, surgical options for lowering the ICP pressure need to be taken into consideration. As the primary goal of treatment is to prevent the loss of vision and visual field, it is important to know whether the communication of CSF between the intracranial CSF and the CSF in the perioptic space is intact. We showed that the CSF flow velocity was decreased in IIH patients with PE compared to healthy controls. The reduced CSF flow might be involved in the pathophysiology of PE in IIH, and diffusion-weighted MRI can be a useful non-invasive tool to study the CSF flow dynamics within the SAS ON.<p>',\n",

He developed severe paraparesis and significant dependency in the activities of daily life. A first cycle of intensive rehabilitation provided the patient with some significant functional outcomes, although he experienced a worsening of the clinical condition after two months of rest, before admission to our rehabilitation unit.

Spinal magnetic resonance imaging revealed a longitudinal abnormality extending from the medulla to the entire spinal cord. The patient was positive for anti-aquaporin-4 antibody (AQP4-IgG) in both the serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which confirmed the diagnosis of NMOSD. Thus, recombinant IFNÎ±-2b was suspended immediately. Because his condition did not improve after 6-day treatment of methylprednisolone pulse therapy (1,000 mg for 3 days, then 500 mg for 3 days), intravenous immunoglobulin (0.4 g/kg/day for 5 days) was administered.

We report on two cases of IEA injury due to femoral venipuncture for neuroendovascular intervention that resulted in hemorrhagic shock and required transcatheter arterial embolization.<p><h>Case Presentations<h><p>A 67-year-old woman and a 71-year-old man receiving dual antiplatelet therapy sustained injury to a branch of the IEA in the process of right femoral venipuncture for neuroendovascular intervention. In both cases, stent placement in the intracranial artery was accomplished as intended with systemic heparinization throughout the procedure; however, the patients became hypotensive during the procedure, and contrast-enhanced CT scans taken after the stenting revealed extravasation of contrast from the IEA and retroperitoneal hematoma. Transcatheter arterial embolization of the bleeding branch of the IEA was performed with the left femoral approach, and subsequent angiography confirmed the disappearance of the extravasation of contrast.<p><h>Conclusion<h><p>Femoral venipuncture for neuroendovascular intervention in patients receiving antithrombotic agents may cause IEA injury requiring transcatheter arterial embolization. The risk of IEA injury may be reduced by using the femoral head as a reference, performing ultrasound-guided puncture, and confirming the course of the IEA by femoral angiography before venipuncture.<p>',\n",

Centromedian nucleus of the thalamus (CM) deep brain stimulation (DBS) may be a viable treatment for GGE. Here, we present the case of a 27-year-old cognitively normal woman with drug resistant GGE, with childhood onset. Seizure semiology are absence seizures and generalized onset tonic clonic (GTC) seizures. At baseline she had 4â\\x80\\x938 GTC seizures per month and weekly absence seizures despite three antiseizure medications and vagus nerve stimulation. A multidisciplinary committee recommended off-label use of CM DBS in this patient. Over 12-months of CM DBS she had two GTC seizure days, which were in the setting of medication withdrawal and illness, and no GTC seizures in the last 6 months. There was no significant change in the burden of absence seizures. Presently, just two studies clearly document CM DBS in cognitively normal individuals with GGE or idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) [in contrast to studies of cognitively impaired individuals with developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEE)]. Our results suggest that CM DBS can be an effective treatment for cognitively normal individuals with GGE and underscore the need for prospective studies of CM DBS.<p>',\n",

       " '<h>ABSTRACT<h><p>Two cases of optic neuropathy due to superficial siderosis (SS) are reported in two patients, aged 29 and 38 years, operated for intracranial neoplasms, the first one with a desmoplasic infantile ganglioglioma excised in 1991, and the other one with a pilocytic astrocytoma, operated on in 1997, 1998 and 2016. Both patients presented with progressive loss of visual acuity, as a result of bilateral optic nerve atrophy, as well as unsteadiness, ataxic gait and hearing loss. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and spine, including gradient echo (GRE) T2-weighted acquisitions, revealed thin optic nerves and strong hypointensity with susceptibility artefacts corresponding to haemosiderin deposits within the meningeal layers of the spine, the infra- and supratentorial spaces of the brain and the peri-optic sheaths in both patients. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was macroscopically haemorrhagic in one patient, who underwent a dynamic myelography, which failed to reveal any trans-dural CSF leakage. Neuro-ophthalmological symptoms due to SS, such as visual acuity loss, have been scarcely reported. MRI using GRE T2-weighted sequences highlighting the presence of haemosiderin deposits plays a key role in the diagnosis of this condition. Treatment should aim at preventing haemosiderin deposition by treating the cause of the subarachnoid bleeding.<p>',\n",

Retrospective analysis of patient records included cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and neuropsychological testing using the CERAD-plus.<p><h>Results<h><p>Because of her unknown onset of progressive cognitive dysfunction in conjunction with speech and language problems, we decided to take an extensive differential diagnostic approach including a search for neural autoantibodies potentially involved in cognitive impairment. Our patient presented serum and CSF neurochondrin autoantibodies. Further CSF analysis revealed elevated tau and ptau 181 protein as well as a reduced AÃ\\x9f42/40 ratio in CSF, thus matching a biomarker profile of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Neuropsychological tests revealed predominant and severe deficits in verbal and visual memory.

She is also likely to have neurochondrin autoimmunity, as we detected neurochondrin autoantibodies in her CSF; we therefore diagnosed AD dementia associated with neurochondrin antibodies. Our case expands the spectrum of neurochondrin autoimmunity to disorders involving major cognitive disorder such as AD dementia. Furthermore, we speculate that neurochondrin autoimmunity might have triggered an acceleration of AD symptoms as its onset was reported only after a short 6-month interval via a synergistic or negatively additive hybrid mechanism of action between neurodegeneration and autoimmunity.<p>\",\n",
       " '<h>Abstract<h><p>Hirayama disease (HD) is a rare, benign, and nonprogressive motor neuron disease (MND) affecting the upper limbs. It usually presents with weakness and amyotrophy in a single upper extremity with an insidious onset between adolescence and the third decade of life. Since its description in 1959, HD has been known under several names and eponyms in Europe and in Asian countries probably due to its heterogeneous clinical features. Thus, the unclear nosological classification makes challenging the differential diagnosis between HD and other neuromuscular conditions, such as MNDs. However, apart from the nosological difficulties and the lack of evidenceâ\\x80\\x90based guideline for diagnosis, the neuroimaging is the mainstay for the diagnosis of HD. Indeed, the specific findings on cervical flexion MRI usually lead to a prompt diagnosis. Here, we reviewed the nosological classifications of HD and its neuroimaging features. Also, we report a case of a 18â\\x80\\x90yearâ\\x80\\x90old boy who presented to our Clinic complaining of muscle weakness of the left distal upper limb without other neurological signs. The cervical MRI, in the neutral position, revealed a high T2 signal intensity in the C5â\\x80\\x90C7 cervical myelomeres as well as the loss of cervical lordosis, whereas, during neck flexion, it showed the anterior displacement of the posterior dura ad the postâ\\x80\\x90gadolinium T1â\\x80\\x90weighted imaging enhancement of the posterior epidural plexus.

Moreover, extra-ocular manifestations such as cardiac conduction abnormalities and neurological manifestations such as multiple sclerosis (MS) like disease or parkinsonism are encountered in some patients. Abnormal findings in spinal cord MR imaging or in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have been observed in previous cases of LHON-associated myelopathy.<p><h>Case presentation<h><p>We report a male patient with LHON who developed symptoms of myelopathy including gait unsteadiness, enhanced deep tendon reflexes and sensory loss of the lower extremities.

       " '<p>Body representation disorders are complex, varied, striking, and very disabling in most cases. Deficits of body representation have been described after lesions to multimodal and sensorimotor cortical areas. A few studies have reported the effects of tumors on the representation of the body, but little is known about the changes after tumor resection. Moreover, the impact of brain lesions on the hand size representation has been investigated in few clinical cases. Hands are of special importance, as no other body part has the ability for movement and interaction with the environment that the hands have, and we use them for a multitude of daily activities. Studies with clinical population can add further knowledge into the way hands are represented. Here, we report a single case study of a patient (AM) who was an expert bodybuilder and underwent a surgery to remove a glioblastoma in the left posterior prefrontal and precentral cortex at the level of the handâ\\x80\\x99s motor region. Pre- (20Â\\xa0days) and post- (4Â\\xa0months) surgery assessment did not show any motor or cognitive impairments. A hand localization task was used, before and after surgery (12Â\\xa0months), to measure possible changes of the metric representation of his right hand. Results showed a post-surgery modulation of the typically distorted hand representation, with an overall accuracy improvement, especially on width dimension. These findings support the direct involvement of sensorimotor areas in the implicit representation of the body size and its relevance on defining specific size representation dimensions.<p>',\n",

The objectives of this report is to explore the effect of tDCS on clinical symptoms and cerebral function in a patient with comorbid GAD and depression.<p><h>Methods<h><p>Our subject was a semiprofessional athlete diagnosed with comorbid GAD and depression. Symptoms included palpitations, sweating, continuous tension, and anxiety.

Treatment consisted of 2 series of 15 days each, separated by a 3-week washout period.

In addition, we collected functional magnetic resonance imaging data before and after the second series.<p><h>Results<h><p>After the first series, the scores of the three questionnaires (BAI, BDI and PSQI) decreased significantly, which showed the trend of improvement. The functional connection of bilateral prefrontal partial channels decreased significantly immediately after tDCS treatment.

In recent years, there have been several NS cases that manifest as limbic encephalitis (LE). Therefore, the diagnosis of neurosyphilis in the early stages is difficult. Here, we present a case of an NS patient who presented with LE manifestation. The 62-year-old woman presented with acute clinical manifestations of gibberish speech, poor memory, and seizures. Brain MRI showed abnormal signals on the right medial temporal lobe. In addition, the patient had a positive serum leucine-rich glioma inactivated 1 (LGI1) antibody with a titer of 1:16. Therefore, an initial diagnosis of anti-LGI1 encephalitis was made. However, further tests carried out showed positive rapid plasma reagin (RPR), and treponema pallidum particle agglutination (TPPA) tests both in the serum and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Therefore, uncertainty arose as to whether the patient had both anti-LGI1 encephalitis and NS or whether the LGI1 antibody and LE manifestations were due to the NS. The patient was initiated on the recommended dose of penicillin G sodium. Following treatment, the patient reported a significant improvement in clinical symptoms, normal signals in the right temporal lobe, and a negative serum LGI1 antibody. These findings suggested that NS induced the LE manifestations and the production of the LGI1 antibody. This case demonstrates that testing syphilis in patients with LE is important and positive autoimmune encephalitis (AE) antibodies in NS patients need to be viewed and interpreted with greater caution.<p>',\n",

In this study, we examine the presence of SARS-CoV-2 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and the cytokine profile in cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) from two patients with a brain tumor and COVID-19. To determine the BBB damage, we evaluate the Q- albumin index, which is an indirect parameter to assess the permeability of this structure. The Q-albumin index of the patient with an intraventricular brain tumor suggests that the BBB is undamaged, preventing the passage of SARS-CoV-2 and pro-inflammatory molecules. The development of brain tumors that disrupt the BBB (measured by the Q-albumin index), in this case, a petroclival meningioma (Case 1), allows the free passage of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and probably lets the free transit of pro-inflammatory molecules to the CNS, which leads to a possible activation of the microglia (astrogliosis) and an exacerbated immune response represented by IL-13, IFN-Î³, and IL-2 trying to inhibit both the infection and the carcinogenic process.<p>',\n",

       " '<p>Background: Central nervous system involvement is uncommon in patients with sarcoidosis. It remains a diagnostic challenge for clinicians, as there is a broad differential diagnosis that matches the presenting neurological signs.

One understudied finding in patients with neurosarcoidosis is the presence of medullary vein engorgement on SWI imaging, termed the â\\x80\\x9cmedullary vein signâ\\x80\\x9d, which has been postulated to be a specific sign for neurosarcoidosis. This study aims to provide an understanding of the diagnostic potential of the medullary vein sign. Methods: Thirty-two patients who presented with neurologic signs concerning for possible neurosarcoidosis were analyzed retrospectively for the presence of the medullary vein sign. Results: Out of these cases, 7 cases of definitive neurosarcoidosis cases were found based on other imaging signs, biopsy and CSF analysis; the remaining were classified into groups as possible (16), probable (5) and (4) cases of other infectious meningoencephalitis including 2 cases of autoimmune encephalitis. Seven patients among all of these cases were found to have the medullary vein sign on imaging, with five cases with confirmed and two cases from possible neurosarcoidosis. The sensitivity of the medullary vein sign in this study was 71.4%, and the specificity was 92.3%. Discussion: The benefits of improving diagnostic criteria for neurosarcoidosis include more rapid diagnosis leading to more prompt treatment, less exposure to potentially harmful antibiotics or antifungals, and less long-term neurological effects. Our results support that the medullary vein sign will potentially fill in the diagnostic gaps that have challenged the timely diagnosis of neurosarcoidosis.

Vim-thalamotomy using focused ultrasound therapy (FUS) was initially performed but failed to control tremor. Subsequently, we performed DBS using two leads to stimulate four different structures. Accordingly, one lead was implanted with the aim of targeting the ventral oralis nucleus (Vo)/zona incerta (Zi), and the other with the aim of targeting the Vim/prelemniscal radiation (Raprl). Electrode stimulation revealed that Raprl and Zi had obvious effects. Postoperatively, the patient achieved good tremor control without any side effects, which was maintained for two years. Considering that she demonstrated resting, postural, and intention/action tremor, and Vim-thalamotomy by FUS was insufficient for tremor control, complicated pathogenesis was presumed in her symptoms including both the cerebellothalamic and the pallidothalamic pathways. Using the dual-lead DBS technique, we have more choices to adjust the stimulation at multiple sites, where different functional networks are connected. Intractable tremors, such as Holmes tremor, may have complicated pathology, therefore, modulating multiple pathological networks is necessary. We suggest that the dual-lead DBS (Vo/Raprl and Vim/Zi) presented here is safe, technically feasible, and possibly effective for the control of Holmes tremor.<p>',\n",

Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed bilateral cortical lesions mainly on the right hemisphere, and new lesions developed in frontal, parietal, occipital and temporal lobes around the old lesions presenting as a lace-like or ring-like enhancement in T1 with contrast over a disease course of five years. A suspected diagnosis of primary angiitis of the central nervous system was initially considered. Treated with high-dose corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulins and monthly pulse cyclophosphamide, his symptoms worsened with the intracranial lesion progression. Brain biopsy of the right frontal lobe was performed nearly five years after onset; prominent neuronal loss, a microglial nodule, as well as parenchymal and perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate within the cortex were found, which coincided with RE pathology changes. Encouragingly, after a regimen of rituximab, lesions on the follow-up brain MRI tended to be stable. Apparently, it was immune-mediated, but did not strictly fit any known disease entity, although it was similar to RE.

We present a 61-year-old male with a 12-year history of limb weakness, muscle wasting, cramps, clumsiness, progressive unsteady gait, and fine motor impairments. His medical history included the resection of a left parietal meningioma and a myxopapillary ependymoma near the conus terminalis (L3/4) at the age of 51 years. The clinical examination revealed a motor neuron syndrome with a clear bilateral wasting of the hand muscles, a diffuse atrophy of the shoulder and calf muscles, and a weakness of the arms, fingers, hips, and feet.

       " \"<p>Tremor of the upper extremity is a significant cause of disability in some patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). The MS tremor is complex because it contains an ataxic intentional tremor component due to the involvement of the cerebellum and cerebellar outflow pathways by MS plaques, which makes the MS tremor, in general, less responsive to medications or deep brain stimulation (DBS) than those associated with essential tremor or Parkinson's disease. The cerebellar component has been thought to be the main reason for making DBS less effective, although it is not clear whether it is due to the lack of suppression of the ataxic tremor by DBS or else. The goal of this study was to clarify the effect of DBS on cerebellar tremor compared to non-cerebellar tremor in a patient with MS. By wearing an accelerometer on the index finger of each hand, we were able to quantitatively characterize kinetic tremor by frequency and amplitude, with cerebellar ataxia component on one hand and that without cerebellar component on the other hand, at the beginning and end of the hand movement approaching a target at DBS Off and On status. We found that cerebellar tremor surprisingly had as good a response to DBS as the tremor without a cerebellar component, but the function control on cerebellar tremor was not as good due to its distal oscillation, which made the amplitude of tremor increasingly greater as it approached the target. This explains why cerebellar tremor or MS tremor with cerebellar component has a poor functional transformation even with a good percentage of tremor control. This case study provides a better understanding of the effect of DBS on cerebellar tremor and MS tremor by using a wearable device, which could help future studies improve patient selection and outcome prediction for DBS treatment of this disabling tremor.<p>\",\n",

He also complained of attention and memory difficulties, fluctuating limb dysesthesia, and weakness of his left arm. After neurological examination, a diagnosis of FND was made. Notably, the patient was also evaluated at a post-COVID center and received a diagnosis of long COVID-19 syndrome. After 4 months of psychoanalytic psychotherapy and targeted physical therapy in our center for FNDs, dysesthesia and motor symptoms had resolved, and the subjective cognitive complaints had improved significantly. However, the patient had not fully recovered as mild symptoms persisted limiting physical activities. Long-term post COVID symptoms and FNDs may share underlying biological mechanisms, such as stress and inflammation. Our case suggests that functional symptoms may coexist with the long COVID symptoms and may improve with targeted interventions.

The association of ITPR1-IgG/anti-Sj with manifestations other than ACA is corroborated by the case of a 48-year-old woman with high-titre ITPR1-IgG/anti-Sj antibodies and rapid cognitive decline, affecting memory, attention and executive function, and psychotic manifestations, including hallucinations, investigated here in detail. FDG-PET revealed right-temporal glucose hypermetabolism compatible with limbic encephalitis. Interestingly, ITPR1-IgG/anti-Sj mainly belonged to the IgG2 subclass in both serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in this and further patients, while it was predominantly IgG1 in other patients, including those with more severe outcome, and remained detectable over the entire course of disease.

       " '<h>Background<h><p>Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis is an immune-mediated disorder characterized by antibodies against the GluN1 subunit of the NMDA receptor that is increasingly recognized as a treatable cause of childhood epileptic encephalopathy. In adults, the disorder has been associated with reversible changes in brain volume over the course of treatment and recovery, but in children, little is known about its time course and associated imaging manifestations.<p><h>Case presentation<h><p>A previously healthy 20-month-old boy presented with first-time unprovoked seizures, dysautonomia, and dyskinesia. Paraneoplastic workup was negative, but CSF was positive for anti-NMDAR antibodies. The patientâ\\x80\\x99s clinical condition waxed and waned over a 14-month course of treatment with first- and second-line immunotherapies (including steroids, IVIG, rituximab, and cyclophosphamide). Serial brain MRIs scans obtained at 5 time points spanning this same period showed no abnormal signal or enhancement but were remarkable for cycles of reversible regional cortical volume loss. All scans included identical 1-mm resolution 3D T1-weighted sequences obtained on the same 3â\\x80\\x89T scanner. Using a novel longitudinal processing stream in FreeSurfer6 (Reuter M, et. al, Neuroimage 61:1402â\\x80\\x9318, 2012) we quantified the rate of change in cortical volume at each vertex (% volume change per month) between consecutive scans and correlated these changes with the time course of the patientâ\\x80\\x99s treatment and clinical response. We found regionally specific changes in cortical volume (up to 7% per month) that preferentially affected the frontal and occipital lobes and paralleled the patientâ\\x80\\x99s clinical course, with clinical decline associated with volume loss and clinical improvement associated with volume gain.<p><h>Conclusions<h><p>Our results suggest that reversible cortical volume loss in anti-NMDA encephalitis has a regional specificity that mirrors many of the clinical symptoms associated with the disorder and tracks the dynamics of disease severity over time. This case illustrates how quantitative morphometric techniques can be applied to clinical imaging data to reveal patterns of brain change that may provide insight into disease pathophysiology. More widespread application of this approach might reveal regional and temporal patterns specific to different types of autoimmune encephalitis, providing a tool for diagnosis and a surrogate marker for monitoring treatment response.<p>',\n",

She later developed CN VII palsy and bilateral enhancement of multiple cranial nerves on neuroimaging.

       " '<p>Awake surgery and intraoperative neuromonitoring represent the gold standard for surgery of lesion located in language-eloquent areas of the dominant hemisphere, enabling the maximal safe resection while preserving language function. Nevertheless, this functional mapping is invasive; it can be executed only during surgery and in selected patients. Moreover, the number of neuro-oncological bilingual patients is constantly growing, and performing awake surgery in this group of patients can be difficult. In this scenario, the application of accurate, repeatable and non-invasive preoperative mapping procedures is needed, in order to define the anatomical distribution of both languages. Repetitive navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (rnTMS) associated with functional subcortical fiber tracking (nTMS-based DTI-FT) represents a promising and comprehensive mapping tool to display language pathway and function reorganization in neurosurgical patients. Herein we report a case of a bilingual patient affected by brain tumor in the left temporal lobe, who underwent rnTMS mapping for both languages (Romanian and Italian), disclosing the true eloquence of the anterior part of the lesion in both tests. After surgery, language abilities were intact at follow-up in both languages. This case represents a preliminary application of nTMS-based DTI-FT in neurosurgery for brain tumor in eloquent areas in a bilingual patient.<p>',\n",

An epileptic seizure was the main symptom of cortical encephalitis in these patients, while the manifestations of brainstem encephalitis were diverse. Cranial MRI demonstrated abnormal signals in unilateral or bilateral cortical or brainstem. Cerebrospinal fluid studies showed normal or mildly elevated leukocyte counts and protein levels, and a cell-based assay detected positive MOG-IgG in the serum of all patients. Two patients were misdiagnosed at the first attack, and both experienced a relapse. All of them accepted the first-line immunotherapy after a confirmed diagnosis and had a good outcome.<p><h>Conclusion<h><p>Early suspicion of MOG-IgG-associated encephalitis is necessary for any patient with sudden onset of seizures or symptoms of brainstem damage, especially with lesions on unilateral/bilateral cortical or brainstem on brain MRI.<p>',\n",
       " '<p>The purpose of the current case study was to determine the influence of an 8-week home intervention training utilizing a partial hand prosthesis on hemodynamic responses of the brain and gross dexterity in a case participant with congenital unilateral upper-limb reduction deficiency (ULD). The case participant (female, 19 years of age) performed a gross manual dexterity task (Box and Block Test) while measuring brain activity (functional near-infrared spectroscopy; fNIRS) before and after an 8-weeks home intervention training. During baseline, there was a broad cortical activation in the ipsilateral sensorimotor cortex and a non-focalized cortical activation in the contralateral hemisphere, which was non-focalized, while performing a gross manual dexterity task using a prosthesis. After the 8-week home intervention training, however, cortical activation shifted to the contralateral motor cortex while cortical activation was diminished in the ipsilateral hemisphere. Specifically, the oxygenated hemodynamics (HbO) responses increased in the medial aspects of the contralateral primary motor and somatosensory cortices. Thus, these results suggest that an 8-week prosthetic home intervention was able to strengthen contralateral connections in this young adult with congenital partial hand reduction. This was supported by the case participant showing after training an increased flexor tone, increased range of motion of the wrist, and decreased times to complete various gross dexterity tasks. Changes in HbO responses due to the home intervention training follow the mechanisms of use-dependent plasticity and further guide the use of prostheses as a rehabilitation strategy for individuals with ULD.<p>',\n",

This condition usually results from entrapment of the common fibular nerve due to loss of the fat pad surrounding the fibular head. Several etiologies of common fibular nerve palsy have been proposed, including trauma, surgical complications, improperly fitted casts or braces, tumors and cysts, metabolic syndromes, and positional factors. We present 5 cases of slimmer's paralysis in patients who had lost 32â\\x80\\x9357 kg in approximately 1 year. In 2 cases, MR neurogram of the knee demonstrated abnormalities of the common fibular nerve at the fibular head.

Weight loss, diabetes mellitus, and immobilization may have contributed to slimmer's paralysis in 1 case. Awareness of slimmer's paralysis in patients who have lost a significant amount of weight in a short period of time is imperative to detect and treat a fibular nerve neuropathy that may ensue.<p>\",\n",

Forty minutes after positioning the patient to prone, the IONM team identified a positive change in the patientâ\\x80\\x99s motor responses in the bilateral lower extremities and alerted the surgical team in a timely manner. It turned out that the pressure exerted by gravity on the patientâ\\x80\\x99s large pannus resulted in further dislocation of the fracture and narrowing of the spinal canal. The surgical team acknowledged the serious risk of spinal cord compression and, hence, immediately changed the surgical plan to an urgent, open approach for decompression and reduction of the fracture.

Responsive neurostimulation (RNS) is a promising therapy for pediatric patients with drug-resistant epilepsy and has been shown to be an effective therapy for reducing seizure frequency and severity in adult patients. RNS of the centromedian nucleus of the thalamus may help to prevent loss of awareness during seizure activity in PGE patients with absence seizures. Here we present a 16-year-old male, with drug-resistant PGE with absence seizures, characterized by 3 Hz spike-and-slow-wave discharges on EEG, who achieved a 75% reduction in seizure frequency following bilateral RNS of the centromedian nuclei. At 6-months post-implant, this patient reported complete resolution of the baseline daily absence seizure activity, and decrease from 3â\\x80\\x934 generalized convulsive seizures per month to 1 per month. RNS recordings showed well-formed 3 Hz spike-wave discharges in bilateral CM nuclei, further supporting the notion that clinically relevant ictal discharges in PGE can be detected in CM.

Lorlatinib was started orally with a dose of 100 mg/day. The patient showed rapid clinical improvement after one week. The patient was alert and the headache disappeared, while the paraparesis improved to normal ambulatory status. Two months of lorlatinib treatment resulted in almost complete disappearance of previous leptomeningeal enhancement of brain and spinal cord, and absence of newly developed metastatic lesions in the central nervous system, based on MRI results. The patient had been regularly followed with ongoing lorlatinib therapy for 5 months without any systemic complications or neurological abnormality. Conclusively, lorlatinib could be a rapid and effective treatment for patients with central nervous system leptomeningeal metastases arising from ALK-positive lung cancer.<p>',\n",

Early high-dose corticosteroid therapy is recommended to rapidly resolve acute episodes. However, the pathophysiology and therapeutic options for this disorder remain to be fully elucidated. We report a case with typical clinical features of RPON successfully treated with beta-blocker eye drop instillation after the effects of high-dose corticosteroid and other therapies were not sufficient.

A 70-year-old female patient presented with numbness in the left side of face, arm, and leg. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a lesion with intense gadolinium (Gd)-enhancement in the ventral portion of the midbrain. A stereotactic biopsy demonstrated mixed T-cell and B-cell infiltrating inflammatory lesions without demyelination. Three months after postoperative treatment with steroid, the lesion markedly decreased on follow-up MRI. Twenty-six months after the initial attack, she complained of dysarthria and urinary incontinence. Repetitive MRI showed a lesion with homogeneous enhancement, extensively involving the bilateral cerebral hemisphere, corpus callosum, and the right middle cerebellar peduncle. The confirmed diagnosis was diffuse large B-cell lymphoma on the second biopsy. Despite our best efforts, she died 38 months after disease onset. Based on review of the literature and our case, preceding inflammatory lesions are not always demyelinating and T-cell dominant inflammatory lesions.

GAD-related TLE has poor response to anti-seizure medications and immune therapies, and epilepsy surgery is rarely successful. We report on a 47-year-old female with history of migraine, autoimmune thyroid disease, ankylosing spondylitis, and drug-resistant TLE. A video electroencephalography recorded frequent seizures with temporo-insular semiology, correlating to left temporal epileptiform activity and left mesiotemporal hyperintensity on magnetic resonance imaging. GAD autoimmunity was confirmed by very high GAD antibody titers in serum and cerebrospinal fluid. Steroids, immunoglobulins, and cyclophosphamide had no effect, and selective left amygdalectomy was performed based on very restricted hypermetabolism on positron-emission tomography. After transient seizure freedom, significant epilepsy improvement was observed in spite of memory decline. Transient worsening was noted 1 year later during diabetes mellitus manifestation and 5 years later during presentation of progressive CA, which stabilized on rituximab treatment.

Both patients presented with progressive loss of visual acuity, as a result of bilateral optic nerve atrophy, as well as unsteadiness, ataxic gait and hearing loss. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and spine, including gradient echo (GRE) T2-weighted acquisitions, revealed thin optic nerves and strong hypointensity with susceptibility artefacts corresponding to haemosiderin deposits within the meningeal layers of the spine, the infra- and supratentorial spaces of the brain and the peri-optic sheaths in both patients. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was macroscopically haemorrhagic in one patient, who underwent a dynamic myelography, which failed to reveal any trans-dural CSF leakage. Neuro-ophthalmological symptoms due to SS, such as visual acuity loss, have been scarcely reported. MRI using GRE T2-weighted sequences highlighting the presence of haemosiderin deposits plays a key role in the diagnosis of this condition.

However, an association between TCM and Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis (BBE) has rarely been described. During the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, growing evidence indicates that COVID-19 often leads to various neurological disorders, but there are few reports of an association between COVID-19 and BBE. Here we report a case of TCM associated with BBE triggered by COVID-19, which subsided with immunotherapy for BBE.

In this study, a 25-year-old woman with NF1 and left optic radiation (OR) glioma underwent surgery to remove the glioma. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) revealed a Pilocytic Astrocytoma (PA) WHO grade I. Post-operation chemotherapy done using nine treatment cycles of administering Temozolomide (TMZ) for 5 days every 4 weeks. Applying the region of interest (ROI) differential tractography method and SWAP four times every 3 months allowed us to follow the patient's visual acuity alterations longitudinally. The differential deterministic tractography method and statistical analyses enabled us to discover the white matter (WM) tracts anisotropy alterations over time. Furthermore, statistical analyses on the SWAP results along time illustrated possible alterations in visual acuity. Then, we could compare and associate the findings with the SWAP examinations and patient symptoms longitudinally. Statistical analyses of SWAP tests revealed a significant improvement in visual fields, and longitudinal differential tractography showed myelination and dense axonal packing in the left OR after 1 year of treatment. In this study, we examined an old hypothesis suggesting that chemotherapy is more effective than radiotherapy for NF1 patients with OP gliomas (OPGs) because of the radiation side effects on the visual field, cognition, and cerebrovascular complications. Our longitudinal clinical case study involving dMRI and SWAP on a single NF1-OPG patient showed that chemotherapy did not suppress the OP myelination over time. However, it should be noted that this is a clinical case study, and, therefore, the generalization of results is limited.

Irrespective of endocrinal disturbances, these patients sometimes demonstrate mood abnormalities, cognitive deterioration, and psychotic symptoms, in such cases usually other symptoms prevail in the clinical picture. Only rare anecdotal case reports are available in which isolated neuropsychiatric or cognitive symptoms were the presenting features of pituitary adenomas. We report a 17-year-old boy with non-functioning pituitary macroadenoma, who presented with depressive symptoms for 6 months, along with predominantly mood-congruent psychotic features and anterograde memory impairment. On subsequent evaluation, he was found to have subclinical abnormalities in visual field testing. His endocrinological and other ancillary investigations were normal. He partially responded to multiple antidepressants and is currently being planned for surgical intervention. Hence, clinicians need to perform neuroimaging in cases with depressive symptoms, when the course is atypical, unsatisfactory response to multiple antidepressants, prominent psychotic/memory-related symptoms to rule out secondary causes. In such cases, pituitary adenomas should also be considered as one of the clinical differentials.<p>',\n",

In this case series, we evaluated changes in connectivity within the auditory-motor network and changes in upper extremity function following a 3-week intensive piano training in two stroke survivors presenting different levels of motor impairment. Connectivity was assessed pre- and post-training in the Î±- and the Î²-bands within the auditory-motor network using magnetoencephalography while participants were passively listening to a standardized melody. Changes in manual dexterity, grip strength, movement coordination, and use of the upper extremity were also documented in both stroke survivors. After training, an increase in the clinical measures was accompanied by enhancements in connectivity between the auditory and motor network nodes for both the Î±- and the Î²-bands, especially in the affected hemisphere.

       " '<p>Patients with drug-resistant focal onset epilepsy are not always suitable candidates for resective surgery, a definitive intervention to control their seizures. The alternative surgical treatment for these patients in Japan has been vagus nerve stimulation (VNS). Besides VNS, epileptologists in the United States can choose a novel palliative option called responsive neurostimulation (RNS), a closed-loop neuromodulation system approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2013. The RNS System continuously monitors neural electroencephalography (EEG) activity at the possible seizure onset zone (SOZ) where electrodes are placed and responds with electrical stimulation when a pre-defined epileptic activity is detected. The controlled clinical trials in the United States have demonstrated long-term utility and safety of the RNS System. Seizure reduction rates have continued to improve over time, reaching 75% over 9 years of treatment. The incidence of implant-site infection, the most frequent device-related adverse event, is similar to those of other neuromodulation devices. The RNS System has shown favorable efficacy for both mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and neocortical epilepsy of the eloquent cortex. Another unique advantage of the RNS System is its ability to provide chronic monitoring of ambulatory electrocorticography (ECoG). Valuable information obtained from ECoG monitoring provides a better understanding of the state of epilepsy in each patient and improves clinical management. This article reviews the developmental history, structure, and clinical utility of the RNS System, and discusses its indications as a novel palliative option for drug-resistant epilepsy.<p>',\n",

Through this case report, we aim to broaden the spectrum of anti-AP3B2-associated disease. Case description: We report on a 51-year-old woman with a brain injury approximately 28 years ago who recently underwent neuropsychological testing, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain (cMRI), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. Neural autoantibodies were determined in serum and CSF. Our patient suffered from mild cognitive impairment (amnestic MCI, multiple domains) with stable memory deficits and a decline in verbal fluency and processing speed within a two-year interval after the first presentation in our memory clinic. Brain MRI showed brain damage in the right temporoparietal, frontolateral region and thalamus, as well as in the left posterior border of the capsula interna and white matter in the frontal region. Since the brain damage, she suffered paresis of the upper extremities on the left side and lower extremities on the right side as well as gait disturbance. Our search for autoantibodies revealed anti-AP3B2 autoantibodies in serum. Conclusions: Our report expands the spectrum of symptoms to mild cognitive impairment in addition to a gait disturbance associated with anti-AP3B2 autoantibodies. Furthermore, it is conceivable that a prior traumatic brain injury could initiate the development of anti-AP3B2-antibody-associated brain autoimmunity, reported here for the first time.<p>',\n",

Case Report: A 67-year-old female presented with three weeksâ\\x80\\x99 history of memory loss, fatigue, insomnia, nausea, and occasional dysphasia. Physical examination was unremarkable, yet cerebral CT and MRI showed bilateral frontal lobe vasogenic oedema. Extensive investigations, including: biochemical; radiological; immunological; microbiological; haematological; histopathological; and cytological, failed to establish a confirmed diagnosis. A multidisciplinary team could not achieve a consensus for this atypical presentation. Brain biopsy was unusual, showing destructive inflammatory and subtly granulomatous disease, but an exhaustive list of auxiliary tests could not confirm a cause, and consensus favoured glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) autoimmune encephalopathy. Discussion: A definitive diagnosis could not be established for this patient despite a gamut of investigations. Although some of the presenting features were consistent with GFAP astrocytopathy, initial staining of the patientâ\\x80\\x99s CSF for neuronal antibodies was negative. Her symptoms and radiological changes of brain imaging improved without any corticosteroid therapy.

       " \"<p>Tremor of the upper extremity is a significant cause of disability in some patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). The MS tremor is complex because it contains an ataxic intentional tremor component due to the involvement of the cerebellum and cerebellar outflow pathways by MS plaques, which makes the MS tremor, in general, less responsive to medications or deep brain stimulation (DBS) than those associated with essential tremor or Parkinson's disease. The cerebellar component has been thought to be the main reason for making DBS less effective, although it is not clear whether it is due to the lack of suppression of the ataxic tremor by DBS or else. The goal of this study was to clarify the effect of DBS on cerebellar tremor compared to non-cerebellar tremor in a patient with MS. By wearing an accelerometer on the index finger of each hand, we were able to quantitatively characterize kinetic tremor by frequency and amplitude, with cerebellar ataxia component on one hand and that without cerebellar component on the other hand, at the beginning and end of the hand movement approaching a target at DBS Off and On status. We found that cerebellar tremor surprisingly had as good a response to DBS as the tremor without a cerebellar component, but the function control on cerebellar tremor was not as good due to its distal oscillation, which made the amplitude of tremor increasingly greater as it approached the target. This explains why cerebellar tremor or MS tremor with cerebellar component has a poor functional transformation even with a good percentage of tremor control. This case study provides a better understanding of the effect of DBS on cerebellar tremor and MS tremor by using a wearable device, which could help future studies improve patient selection and outcome prediction for DBS treatment of this disabling tremor.<p>\",\n",

After 4 months of psychoanalytic psychotherapy and targeted physical therapy in our center for FNDs, dysesthesia and motor symptoms had resolved, and the subjective cognitive complaints had improved significantly. However, the patient had not fully recovered as mild symptoms persisted limiting physical activities. Long-term post COVID symptoms and FNDs may share underlying biological mechanisms, such as stress and inflammation. Our case suggests that functional symptoms may coexist with the long COVID symptoms and may improve with targeted interventions.

       " \"<p>Circadian and other physiological rhythms play a key role in both normal homeostasis and disease processes. Such is the case of circadian and infradian seizure patterns observed in epilepsy. However, these rhythms are not fully exploited in the design of active implantable medical devices. In this paper we explore a new implantable stimulator that implements chronotherapy as a feedforward input to supplement both open-loop and closed-loop methods. This integrated algorithm allows for stimulation to be adjusted to the ultradian, circadian and infradian patterns observed in patients through slowly-varying temporal adjustments of stimulation and algorithm sub-components, while also enabling adaption of stimulation based on immediate physiological needs such as a breakthrough seizure or change of posture. Embedded physiological sensors in the stimulator can be used to refine the baseline stimulation circadian pattern as a â\\x80\\x9cdigital zeitgeber,â\\x80\\x9d i.e., a source of stimulus that entrains or synchronizes the subject's natural rhythms. This algorithmic approach is tested on a canine with severe drug-resistant idiopathic generalized epilepsy exhibiting a characteristic diurnal pattern correlated with sleep-wake cycles. Prior to implantation, the canine's cluster seizures evolved to status epilepticus (SE) and required emergency pharmacological intervention. The cranially-mounted system was fully-implanted bilaterally into the centromedian nucleus of the thalamus. Using combinations of time-based modulation, thalamocortical rhythm-specific tuning of frequency parameters as well as fast-adaptive modes based on activity, the canine experienced no further SE events post-implant as of the time of writing (7 months). Importantly, no significant cluster seizures have been observed either, allowing the reduction of rescue medication. The use of digitally-enabled chronotherapy as a feedforward signal to augment adaptive neurostimulators could prove a useful algorithmic method in conditions where sensitivity to temporal patterns are characteristics of the disease state, providing a novel mechanism for tailoring a more patient-specific therapy approach.<p>\",\n",

Although most commonly caused by antibodies to the acetylcholine receptor, antibodies against MuSK (muscle-specific kinase) protein can also weaken transmission at the neuromuscular junction. Muscle-specific tyrosine kinase myasthenia gravis (MuSK-Ab MG) is a rare subtype of myasthenia gravis with distinct pathogenesis and unique clinical features. Diagnosis can be challenging due to its atypical presentation as compared to seropositive myasthenia gravis. It responds inconsistently to steroids, but plasma exchange and immunosuppressive therapies have shown promising results. We report a case of a 49-year-old female who presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure. Our patient experienced progressive, undiagnosed MuSK-Ab MG for years without a diagnosis.<p>',\n",
       " '<p>Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a potentially fatal diagnosis composed of hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and autonomic instability. This syndrome has significant systemic complications including acute renal failure, rhabdomyolysis, hyperkalemia, and seizure. It is associated with the use of both typical and atypical antipsychotics. Due to the extensive neurodegenerative destruction of dopaminergic and acetylcholinergic pathways, patients with Lewy body dementia (LBD) are particularly sensitive to antidopaminergic and anticholinergic medications, making them more susceptible to extrapyramidal side effects and NMS. We present a case of a 72-year-old female with LBD who developed muscular rigidity, vital sign instability, and altered mental status after receiving one dose of paliperidone palmitate injection two weeks prior to admission. Initial blood work was unrevealing. Extensive workup including EEG, lumbar puncture with cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and brain MRI was unremarkable. She was treated with seven days of bromocriptine and a lorazepam taper with improvement in muscle rigidity. However, her mental status never improved, and she remained comatose. She was later intubated for airway protection after an aspiration event that led to hypoxia. Her respiratory status never recovered, and she was transitioned to comfort care. This case demonstrates the complexity and potential fatality of NMS. Clinicians should be aware of this dangerous complication of antipsychotic use in patients with LBD as these patients may be more susceptible to this complication.<p>',\n",

The intraocular pressure, external eye examination, ocular motility and anterior segment examinations were normal. Fundus examination revealed severe bilateral papilloedema and engorged tortuous veins in both eyes. Imaging exhibited a large intracranial tumour causing raised intracranial pressure. This was debulked by neurosurgery and histological examination revealed that the tumour was an olfactory neuroblastoma (ONB).

The patient presents alterations to store, consolidate, and recall information. These neurocognitive deficits are accompanied by neurobehavioral disorders such as depression, anxiety, and apathy that contribute to the worsening of the quality of life, with a high impact on the individual, social, and family level. To identify the neurobehavioral disorders and neurocognitive deterioration that present a patient diagnosed with FTD: clinical case of low incidence and prevalence disease in Colombia. A 40-year-old man, with progressive deterioration of his immediate verbal memory, low verbal fluency, aberrant motor behavior, sexual impulsivity, alterations in his executive functions, especially in planning tasks, decision-making, and inhibition was found to have a lesser degree of affectation in his visuospatial functioning and visuoconstructive abilities. It was found that the patient presents a severe dysexecutive syndrome associated with a clinical picture of FTD, correlated with an inability to process and recall information, accompanied by disorders such as depression, anxiety, and apathy. It is necessary to generate a functional neurorehabilitation plan that aims to improve the quality of life in these patients. In the same way, it is necessary to create new lines of research and intervention that have the purpose to create a greater field of heuristics or new questions in this type of neurodegenerative pathologies.<p>',\n",

As early imaging studies are lacking, we aimed to provide a detailed description of imaging and neurophysiology findings in a patient with aSCH, focusing on the early symptomatic stages.<p><h>Case presentation<h><p>We here present the case of a 51-year old male patient with an episode of pain in the right trunk and a normal spinal MRI. After a symptom-free interval of 8â\\x80\\x89years, spasticity and paresis evolved in the right leg. There was subtle ventral displacement and posterior indentation of the thoracic spinal cord on MRI which, in retrospect, was missed as an early sign of aSCH. After another 3â\\x80\\x89years, symptoms spread to the left leg and a sensory deficit of the trunk became evident. Follow-up MRI now clearly showed an aSCH. Neurosurgical intervention consisted of remobilization of the herniated spinal cord and patch closure of the dura defect. Over the following years, motor and sensory symptoms partially improved.<p><h>Conclusions<h><p>The history of this patient with aSCH illustrates the importance of careful longitudinal clinical follow-up with repeated imaging studies in progressive upper motor neuron syndromes.

We demonstrate an approach to evaluate the accuracy of such software for the ventral intermediate nucleus (VIM) using directional leads. In an essential tremor patient with asymmetrical brain anatomy, lead placement was adjusted according to the suggested segmentation made by the software (Brainlab). Postoperatively, we used directionality to assess lead placement using side effect testing (internal capsule and sensory thalamus). Clinical effects were then compared to the patient-specific visualization and VTA simulation in the GUIDEâ\\x84¢ XT software (Boston Scientific). The patientâ\\x80\\x99s asymmetrical anatomy was correctly recognized by the software and matched the clinical results. VTA models matched best for dysarthria (6 out of 6 cases) and sensory hand side effects (5/6), but least for facial side effects (1/6). Best concordance was observed for the modeled current anterior and back spread of the VTA, worst for the current side spread. Automatic anatomical segmentation and VTA models can be valuable tools for DBS planning and programming. Directional DBS leads allow detailed postoperative assessment of the concordance of such image-based simulation and visualization with clinical effects.<p>',\n",

This study evaluated the clinical practice and outcome of DBS for TS in a Japanese institution. This study included 25 consecutive patients with refractory TS treated with thalamic centromedian-parafascicular nucleus DBS. The severity of tics was evaluated with the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) before surgery, at 1 year after surgery, and at the last follow-up of 3 years or more after surgery. The occurrence of adverse events, active contact locations, and stimulation conditions were also evaluated. YGTSS tic severity score decreased by average 45.2% at 1 year, and by 56.6% at the last follow-up. The reduction was significant for all aspects of the scores including motor tics, phonic tics, and impairment. The mean coordinates of active contacts were 7.62 mm lateral to the midline, 3.28 mm posterior to the midcommissural point, and 3.41 mm above anterior commissureâ\\x80\\x93posterior commissure plane. Efficacy and stimulation conditions were equivalent to international reports. The stimulation-induced side effects included dysarthria (32.0%) and paresthesia (12.0%). Device infection occurred in three patients (12.0%) as a surgical complication. The DBS device was removed because of infection in two patients. DBS is an effective treatment for refractory TS, although careful indication is necessary because of the surgical risks and unknown long-term outcome.<p>',\n",

The resultant upregulation of cognate onconeural peptides as MHC1 protein complexes on neural cell surfaces would render those cells susceptible to killing by CD8+ T cells, thus precipitating the patient's neurological symptoms.<p>\",\n",

       " '<p>Post-anoxic leukoencephalopathy is a rare event that causes global demyelination secondary to anoxic injury. Given the nature and extent of the damage, cognitive and functional deficits are typically chronic even after standard therapies. Here, we describe a novel treatment approach that used high definition transcranial direct-current stimulation (HD-tDCS) with a 62-year-old male who was 5 years post-anoxic leukoencephalopathy secondary to an accidental drug overdose. HD-tDCS was administered over the left lateral prefrontal cortex across 29 daily sessions at 2 mA (20 minutes/session) in order to address dysexecutive behaviors. Results demonstrated improved delayed memory and trends for improved visuospatial and semantic fluency performance as well as improved insight and daily functioning, all of which returned to baseline by the end of a 10 week no-contact follow up period. Resting state fMRI connectivity results mirrored these changes by showing increased dorsal attention and cingulo-opercular but reduced ventral attention network connectivity after session 29, all of which returned to baseline at follow-up. These findings suggest HD-tDCS may benefit functioning even following serious and pervasive anoxic injury. Findings also suggest the need for continued HD-tDCS for maintenance purposes, though future work is needed to identify optimal dose-response information.<p>',\n",
       " '<p>Sparse time series models have shown promise in estimating contemporaneous and ongoing brain connectivity. This paper was motivated by a neuroscience experiment using EEG signals as the outcome of our established interventional protocol, a new method in neurorehabilitation toward developing a treatment for visual verticality disorder in post-stroke patients. To analyze the [complex outcome measure (EEG)] that reflects neural-network functioning and processing in more specific ways regarding traditional analyses, we make a comparison among sparse time series models (classic VAR, GLASSO, TSCGM, and TSCGM-modified with non-linear and iterative optimizations) combined with a graphical approach, such as a Dynamic Chain Graph Model (DCGM). These dynamic graphical models were useful in assessing the role of estimating the brain network structure and describing its causal relationship. In addition, the class of DCGM was able to visualize and compare experimental conditions and brain frequency domains [using finite impulse response (FIR) filter]. Moreover, using multilayer networks, the results corroborate with the susceptibility of sparse dynamic models, bypassing the false positives problem in estimation algorithms. We conclude that applying sparse dynamic models to EEG data may be useful for describing intervention-relocated changes in brain connectivity.<p>',\n",

Analogously, its treatment has to be personalized and the patient's response may be idiosyncratic. At this moment there is no cure for it, in addition to its clinical course sometimes being torpid, with a poor response to any treatment. However, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) has demonstrated its usefulness as a non-invasive therapeutic tool for the treatment of some psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases. Some studies show that the application of rTMS implies improvement in patients with MS at various levels, but the effects at the psychometric level and the redox profile in blood have never been studied before, despite the fact that both aspects have been related to the severity of MS and its evolution. Here we present the case of a woman diagnosed with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) at the age of 33, with a rapid progression of her illness and a poor response to different treatments previously prescribed for 9 years. In view of the patient's clinical course, a compassionate treatment with rTMS for 1 year was proposed. Starting from the fourth month of treatment, when reviewing the status of her disease, the patient denoted a clear improvement at different levels. There followed out psychometric evaluations and blood analyses, that showed both an improvement in her neuropsychological functions and a reduction in oxidative stress in plasma, in correspondence with therTMS treatment.<p>\",\n",

The mechanism of action of this effect of zolpidem is of great research interest. In this case study, we use magnetoencephalography (MEG) to investigate a fully conscious, ex-coma patient who suffered from neurological difficulties for a few years due to traumatic brain injury. For a few years after injury, the patient was under medication with zolpidem that drastically improved his symptoms.

An increase in power after zolpidem intake was found in the higher beta/lower gamma (20â\\x80\\x9343â\\x80\\x89Hz) frequency band. Source level functional connectivity measured using weighted-phase lag index showed changes after zolpidem intake. Stronger connectivity between left frontal and temporal brain regions was observed.

       " '<p>Background. An electroencephalogram (EEG) is a simple and widely used assessment tool that allows one to analyze the bioelectric activity of the brain. As a result, one can observe brain waves with different frequencies and amplitudes that correspond to the temporary synchronization of different parts of the brain. Synchronization patterns may be changed by almost any type of pathological conditions, such as psychiatric diseases and structural abnormalities of the brain tissue. In various neuropsychiatric disorders, the coordination of cortical activity may be decreased or enhanced as a result of neurobiological compensatory mechanisms. Methods. In this paper, we analyzed the EEG signals in resting-state condition, with reference to three patients with a similar set of psychopathological symptoms typical for the first psychotic episode, but with different functional and structural neural basis of the disease. Additionally, those patients were compared with a demographically matched healthy individual. We used the non-linear method of time series analysis based on the recurrences of states, to verify whether functional connectivity configurations assessed with recurrence method will qualitatively distinguish patients from a healthy subject, but also differentiate patients from each other. Results. Obtained results confirmed that the connectivity architecture mapped with the recurrence analysis substantially differentiated all participants from each other. An applied analysis additionally showed the specificity of cortical desynchronization and over-synchronization matched to the psychiatric or neurological basis of the disease. Despite this encouraging finding, group-oriented studies are needed to corroborate our qualitative results, based only on a series of clinical case studies.<p>',\n",

Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) can propagate into cranial space with clinically dominant symptoms and signs of typical aneurysmal intracranial SAH.

The source of hemorrhage was not initially identified, leading to a presumptive diagnosis of benign pretruncal non-aneurysmal SAH. The correct diagnosis of spinal thoracolumbar PMAVF was revealed 2.5 months later due to the progression of local symptoms. While the diagnosis was being refined and endovascular treatment was being planned (but delayed due to pregnancy), there was a recurrence of intraconal hemorrhage followed by brainstem hemorrhage.

Neuromodulation therapies are increasingly being investigated as a means of alleviating abnormal sensory disturbances. We report here the response to repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for dysesthesia in a patient with SMON. The patient underwent rTMS treatment once per week for 12 weeks. rTMS was administered at 10 Hz, 90% of the resting motor threshold over the bilateral primary motor cortex foot area, for a total of 1,500 stimuli per day. After the treatment had finished at 12 weeks, the abnormal dysesthesia gradually declined. At first, there were improvements only in the area with a feeling of adherence. Later, this sensation was eliminated. Three months following the application, most of the feeling of adherence had disappeared and the feeling of tightness was slightly reduced. In contrast, the throbbing feeling had not changed during this period. Dysesthesia may indicate a process of central sensitization, which would contribute to chronic neuromuscular dysfunction.

Early high-dose corticosteroid therapy is recommended to rapidly resolve acute episodes. However, the pathophysiology and therapeutic options for this disorder remain to be fully elucidated. We report a case with typical clinical features of RPON successfully treated with beta-blocker eye drop instillation after the effects of high-dose corticosteroid and other therapies were not sufficient.

       " '<p>Approximately 20% of patients with Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) develop optic pathway gliomas (OPGs). Not all OPGs in NF1 necessarily become vision compromising and predicting which patients might develop visual decline is difficult at present time. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has emerged as a useful tool able to directly assess the morphology and thickness of individual retinal layers. The ganglion cell layer (GCL) is composed of the retinal ganglion cells which receive information from photoreceptors via interneurons, while the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) contains the retinal ganglion cell unmyelinated axons that merge to form the optic nerve. Lesions of the anterior visual pathway result in retrograde axonal degeneration from ganglion cell death and ultimately manifest as thinning of the RNFL and/or GCL. In this report we highlight a case of a 38 year-old woman with an NF1 associated left chiasmal and optic tract glioma who had normal visual fields and visual acuity. However, using OCT we demonstrate a homonymous pattern of GCL atrophy that corresponds with her left optic tract glioma. Given this homonymous pattern of atrophy in the GCL and the left optic tract lesion, one would expect a right homonymous hemianopia. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of a homonymous pattern of GCL-IPL atrophy in an adult with an NF1 related OPG involving the optic chiasm and optic tract, but without objective visual field or acuity deficits. This case is important because, mechanistically, it suggests that a necessary threshold of GCL atrophy may be needed before visual concerns can be detected and, secondly, it invites future studies to evaluate whether OCT may serve as a potential screening tool for those with NF1 related OPGs.<p>',\n",

Similarly, the neuronal firing patterns underlying high-frequency oscillations during seizures remain controversial. Using implanted subdural electrodes and a microelectrode array in a patient with focal status epilepticus, in which 40 habitual focal motor seizures and 101 subclinical seizures were captured, the authors analyzed the association of EEG, high-frequency oscillations, and multiunit activity to facial motor semiology. The development of ictal high-frequency oscillations in subdural electrodes overlying face motor cortex was temporally associated with clonic facial movements. In representative seizures selected for multiunit analysis, synchronization of neuronal firing in the adjacent microelectrode array aligned with clinical onset and was greater in clinical seizures compared with subclinical seizures.

The left PFIA was laterally transposed using polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) bands and anchored to the dura mater using three PTFE bands. To achieve adequate transposition, the small blood vessels bridging the spinal cord and PFIA and the dorsal root nerve had to be sacrificed.

Follow-up MRI obtained eleven days later showed interval development of ring enhancement and vasogenic edema surrounding the previously noted core of restricted diffusion. Based on these findings, the diagnosis was revised to cerebral abscesses and the patient was treated successfully with antibiotics. In retrospect, the largest diffusion-weighted lesion on baseline MRI demonstrated two characteristics that were atypical for stroke: it had an ovoid shape and a subtle T2 hypointense core. This case demonstrates that acute clinical and radiographic presentation of cerebral abscess and ischemic stroke can be strikingly similar. Follow-up imaging can be instrumental in arriving at an accurate diagnosis.<p>',\n",

She had experienced her first NMOSD relapse seven years prior with bilateral lower extremity weakness and area postrema syndrome. After pulse steroids and plasma exchange she made a complete neurologic recovery and was started on azathioprine. An initial aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody ELISA test was positive, but three subsequent tests were negative and repeat MRI brain showed resolution of T2/FLAIR signal abnormalities with the exception of a right thalamic lesion and a left medullary lesion. Azathioprine was discontinued after 1 year and she was lost to follow-up. With her second relapse, she had new lesions in her left thalamus and right medullaâ\\x80\\x94a mirror image of the thalamic and medullary lesions associated with her first relapse. In addition, an MRI spine demonstrated a new longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis from T7 to L1 with edematous expansion of the cord. Her serum AQP4 antibody test using a cell-based assay was strongly positive. NMOSD lesions are typically associated with brain regions with high density of the AQP4 channel. These areas include optic nerves, hypothalamus, and the diencephalic and brainstem tissues that surround the cerebral aqueduct and third and fourth ventricles. Previous studies have demonstrated that those with relapsing NMOSD have a predilection for recurrence in the same neuroanatomical region as their first episode. We hypothesize, using data from prior pathologic and epidemiologic studies, that mirror image lesions, where the same anatomic sites are affected on the contralateral side of the brain or spinal cord, may appear in subsequent attacks due to (i) areas of high remaining AQP4 density and/or (ii) local compromise of astrocyte or blood-brain barrier (BBB) function that persists after the initial inciting attack.<p>',\n",

We present the case of a CIDP patient treated successfully with immunosuppression and followed for 31 years with serial standardized clinical and electrophysiological evaluations. Improvement in electrophysiological parameters lagged clinical changes for up to 2 years, but all motor parameters improved (distal motor and F wave latencies, conduction velocities, and compound muscle action potential amplitudes) even with evidence of initial axonal damage. Worsening of electrophysiological parameters, specifically increasing F wave latencies, heralded clinical relapse by as much as a year.

       " \"<p>Manganese accumulation in the central nervous system creates clinical symptoms of cognitive dysfunction, behavioral changes, and movement disorders resembling Parkinson's disease. Radiographic features of this rare clinical entity include symmetric T1 hyperintensities in the bilateral globus pallidi, with corresponding hypointensities on T2-weighted images. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is an increasingly used potentially lifesaving therapy for patients who cannot tolerate enteral nutrition. However, when used over a period of several weeks to months, its associated risks and complications carry significant morbidity and mortality. One of the more rare complications of TPN use is manganese toxicity. We provided care for a 38-year-old female on chronic TPN who presented to the hospital with Parkinsonian features, confusion, falls, and lethargy. MRI brain showed T1 hyperintensities in the bilateral globus pallidi, which were attributed to manganese toxicity from chronic TPN use. Supporting evidence for this rare entity included decreased signal intensity in the bilateral globus pallidi on T2-weighted images and T1 hyperintensities in the substantia nigra. With antifungal treatment and permanent cessation of TPN, her mentation and neurological symptoms began to improve within a week. Repeat MRI brain performed one month after discontinuation of TPN revealed improvement of the T1 hyperintensities in the bilateral globus pallidi. Our objective in presenting this case is to highlight manganese neurotoxicity as a rare complication of TPN in a patient without known hepatic dysfunction and to emphasize the importance of routinely monitoring patients for the possible adverse effects of chronic TPN. Our case is among the handful of published cases in which a patient without known liver dysfunction, which is the primary organ responsible for manganese elimination from the body, developed manganese neurotoxicity.<p>\",\n",

The aim of this study was to identify functional activity in the cerebral cortex after a hypoxic event and to investigate alterations that could be modulated by deep brain stimulation (DBS). A voxel-based subtraction analysis of serial positron emission tomography (PET) scans was performed in a 34-year-old woman with chronic medically refractory PHM that improved with bilateral globus pallidus internus (Gpi) DBS implanted three years after the hypoxic event. The patient required low-frequency stimulation to show myoclonus improvement. Using voxel-based statistical parametric mapping, we identified a decrease in glucose metabolism in the prefrontal lobe including the dorsolateral, orbito-, and inferior prefrontal cortex, which was suspected to be the origin of the myoclonus from postoperative PET/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after DBS. Based on the present study results, voxel-based subtraction of PET appears to be a useful approach for monitoring patients with PHM treated with DBS. Further investigation and continuous follow-up on the use of PET analysis and DBS treatment for patients with PHM are necessary to help understanding the pathophysiology of PHM, or LAS.<p>',\n",

       " 'Background Patients suffering from refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) who have undergone deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery require repeated in-person programming visits. These sessions could be labor-intensive and may not always be feasible, particularly when in-person hospital visits are restricted. Telemedicine is emerging as a potential supplementary tool for post-operative care. However, its reliability and feasibility still require further validation due to the unconventional methods of interaction. Methods A study was conducted on three patients with refractory OCD who had undergone DBS. Most of their programming sessions were completed via a remote programming system. These patients were recruited and monitored for a year. Changes in their clinical symptoms were assessed using the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale–Second Edition (Y-BOCS-II), the Hamilton Anxiety Scale-14 (HAMA), the Hamilton Depression Scale-17 (HAMD), and the Short Form 36 Health Survey Questionnaire (SF-36). The scores from these assessments were reported. Results At the last follow-up, two out of three patients were identified as responders, with their Y-BOCS-II scores improving by more than 35% (P1: 51%, P3: 42%). These patients also experienced some mood benefits. All patients observed a decrease in travel expenses during the study period. No severe adverse events were reported throughout the study. Conclusion The group of patients showed improvement in their OCD symptoms within a 1-year follow-up period after DBS surgery, without compromising safety or benefits. This suggests that telemedicine could be a valuable supplementary tool when in-person visits are limited.',\n",

Methods We reviewed medical records and brain imaging in patients seen at our 2 centers who presented with SIH, SBS, and bvFTD symptoms. Results There were 51 patients (12 women, 39 men) with mean age 55.5 years (range, 26–70 years). MRI showed severe brain sagging in all. Thirteen patients displayed repetitive flexion with breath-holding at the time of clinical presentation. Five patients had repetitive flexion with breath-holding, which resolved before presenting for evaluation. Thus, 35.3% (18) of 51 patients with SBS displayed seemingly compulsive repetitive flexion with breath-holding. Discussion Compulsive repetitive flexion with breath-holding appears to be pathognomonic of SBS, deserving the acronym CoRFBiS (compulsive repetitive flexion with breath-holding in SBS).

       " 'Pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN) is a rare autosomal recessive hereditary neurodegenerative disorder, usually caused by mutations in the pantothenate kinase 2 (PANK2) gene. We report a young female patient with atypical PKAN, harboring a novel heterozygous PANK2 mutation, diagnosed through clinical imaging and genetic analysis. The patient presented with dystonia and motor dysfunction after onset, but early brain MRI showed normal findings. Due to progressive symptom deterioration, her MRI was reevaluated and the characteristic \"eye of the tiger\" sign was identified. Further genetic testing revealed that she was a carrier of two heterozygous PANK2 mutations, one being a known pathogenic variant and the other unknown. Given the patient\\'s clinical presentation, progressive symptoms, and poor response to medication, we boldly attempted asymmetric bilateral deep brain stimulation (abDBS). Postoperative outcomes showed significant symptom improvement. This study suggests that early brain MRI in PKAN patients may not exhibit typical radiological features, leading to potential diagnostic omissions. Furthermore, it highlights the potential therapeutic effect of abDBS in atypical PKAN, particularly in patients with novel heterozygous PANK2 mutations. Asymmetric bilateral deep brain stimulation may represent a promising treatment approach.',\n",
       " 'Background Neuroleptospirosis and anti-dipeptidyl-peptidase-like protein 6 (DPPX) encephalitis are both very rare and have only been reported in the form of respective case reports. There are no reports of anti-DPPX encephalitis combined with neuroleptospirosis in the literature. We reported the first case of neuroleptospirosis combined with elevated DPPX antibodies in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Case presentation A previously healthy 53-year-old Chinese male farmer with a history of drinking raw stream water and flood sewage exposure was brought to the hospital due to an acute onset of neuropsychiatric symptoms. No fever or meningeal irritation signs were detected on physical examination. Routine laboratory investigations, including infection indicators, leukocyte and protein in CSF, electroencephalogram and gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, all revealed normal. While metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) identified the DNA genome of Leptospira interrogans Conclusion We highlight that in patients with acute or subacute behavioral changes, even in the absence of fever, if the most recent freshwater exposure is clear, physicians should pay attention to leptospirosis. Due to the low sensitivity of routine microscopy, culture, polymerase chain reaction and antibody testing, mNGS may have more advantages in diagnosing neuroleptospirosis. As autoimmune encephalitis can be triggered by various infections, neuroleptospirosis may be one of the causes of autoimmune encephalitis. Since neuronal antibody measurements themselves are not that common in neuroleptospirosis, future studies are needed to determine whether the detection of anti-DPPX antibodies is a rare event in leptospirosis. Early identification of autoimmune encephalitis and timely administration of immunotherapy may lead to a better outcome.

Multiple well-delineated nonenhancing T2-hyperintense intramedullary cystic ovoid nodules were visualized within the white matter of the spinal cord, including some immediately abutting the gray matter. No alterations in signal intensity or morphology were detected in a follow-up. Moreover, no relevant clinical symptoms attributable to the lesions were present.

       " \"Background We present a rare case of NeuroBehcet's-related intracranial hypertension without cerebral venous thrombosis (NBrIHwCVT), occurring as the first presentation of NeuroBehcet's. In addition, we describe the novel use of subcutaneous tocilizumab for this indication. This is followed by a review of the literature on this topic. Case The patient was a 28-year-old lady of Southern Chinese origin with a known history of Behcet's disease with oral ulcers and ocular findings for which she was on mycophenolate mofetil and adalimumab. She presented with a headache and bilateral disc swelling associated with an intracranial pressure (ICP) of >â\\x80\\x8940cmH20. There were no structural lesions or cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) on imaging. Initial lumbar puncture had raised leucocytes and protein. We discuss diagnostic challenges given persistently elevated ICP despite subsequent non-inflammatory cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) profiles and non-response to acetazolamide. She eventually showed a response to immunosuppressant therapy in the form of pulsed methylprednisolone, cyclophosphamide and subsequently subcutaneous tocilizumab, supporting the diagnosis of NBrIHwCVT. Complete normalization of ICP remains challenging. Her disease course was severe, unusual for her ethnicity. Literature review We identified 34 patients (including ours) from 14 publications. We found that the majority of NBrIHwCVT patients were young (average age of 34 years), with a slight female preponderance. Of the 17 cases in the literature with available data on CSF profile, none had raised leucocytes whilst one patient had elevated protein. Patients were generally treated with steroids and occasionally azathioprine, in line with the suspected autoimmune pathophysiology. Of 22 patients with data on outcome, six (27%) were noted to have recurrence of symptoms generally occurring a few months later. Conclusion As demonstrated by this case, NBrIHwCVT can present with BD with raised ICP even if there is no prior history of NB, central Asian ethnicity, cerebral venous thrombosis or features of inflammation on the CSF. We demonstrated how novel use of Tocilizumab may have a role in the management of NBrIHwCVT. Based on our literature review, patients were more likely to be young, female, display a non-inflammatory CSF picture, be treated with steroids and harbour a possibility of recurrence.\",\n",

Case presentation A 54-year-old female was admitted in January 2023 for dysuria and progressive numbness and weakness of lower limbs. She had difficulty standing and walking in a straight line. Both lower limbs were positive for the Babinski and Chaddock signs. MRI showed abnormal signals in the spinal cord. Aquaporin-4-IgG (AQP-4-IgG) was positive (1:320), and NMOSD was confirmed. Intravenous immunoglobulin and methylprednisolone were given, and the symptoms improved. She received maintenance treatment with methylprednisolone tablets, and the dosage was gradually reduced. She was readmitted for fatigue, palpitations, and shortness of breath in May 2023. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy showed elevated erythroid precursors and erythroid hypoplasia, with normal megakaryocytes and myeloid precursors. Chest CT showed no mediastinal lymph node enlargement or thymoma. PRCA secondary to NMOSD was diagnosed. Recombinant human erythropoietin was given. Her condition improved after 1.5 months, as indicated by blood cell count and imaging. Conclusions This case suggests that PRCA can be secondary to NMOSD. A comprehensive immune function and bone marrow evaluation might be necessary if abnormal blood cells are found while managing NMOSD.',\n",

We present a case of bilateral femoral neuropathy due to spontaneous psoas hematomas developed during COVID-19 critical illness. A 41-year-old patient developed COVID-19 pneumonia, and his condition deteriorated rapidly. A decrease in the hemoglobin level prompted imaging studies during his intensive care unit (ICU) stay. Bilateral psoas hematomas were identified as the source of bleeding. Thereafter, the patient complained of weakness in both upper and lower limbs and numbness in the lower limb. He was considered to have critical illness neuropathy and was referred to rehabilitation. Electrodiagnostic testing suggested bilateral femoral neuropathy because of compression due to hematomas developed during the course of his ICU stay.

Methods Four paragangliomas were treated with percutaneous embolization using NHCA as the sole embolic material. In one dural arteriovenous fistula (dAVF), NHCA was used in combination with other embolic materials. Procedural specifics, complications and angiographic results were retrospectively evaluated. Results Total or subtotal devascularization was obtained in 3 of the 4 paragangliomas. In the largest tumor, only partial devascularization could be achieved. The dAVF was completely occluded. Catheter entrapment did not occur. After dAVF treatment, the patient had an asymptomatic lacunar infarction, while there was no procedural morbidity related to paraganglioma treatment. Conclusions In this series, neurovascular embolization with NHCA was feasible and effective. It may be particularly beneficial for small and tortuous vessels that require low-profile catheterization and a slow and controlled polymerization. Further studies are necessary to prove the benefits of NHCA over established embolic agents.',\n",

The aim of this study was to assess NMS prevalence in a large cohort of HD patients and explore the main associated risk factors. Methods In 2023, an HD patient was admitted to our neurology department due to NMS. Starting from the case description, we performed a narrative review of the literature of NMS cases in HD, reviewed data from the fifth dataset of the Enrollâ\\x80\\x90HD (a longitudinal, observational, global study of families with HD) study (PDS5) selecting HD patients treated with DRBAs and/or tetrabenazine (TBZ) who presented at least one of the core symptoms of NMS (rigidity and hyperthermia), and collected data to investigate prevalence of NMS and identify risk factors. Results In the Enrollâ\\x80\\x90HD PDS5 dataset, we identified 5108 of 11,569 HD patients who were undergoing DRBA and/or TBZ treatment. Only one patient, a Caucasian man of 46â\\x80\\x89years, undergoing clozapine and valproate treatment, had a registered diagnosis of NMS. Conclusions NMS in HD patients is seldom described. This could be due to an underestimation of this condition. There are no available objective NMS diagnostic criteria at present, and the existence of atypical forms of NMS further complicates diagnosis. Advanced disease stage, rigid–akinetic phenotype, abrupt therapy changes, polytherapy, and dehydration are key risk factors, most of which are preventable through awareness and caution in managing medications in the HD population.',\n",

Isolated neurosarcoidosis and especially a manifestation with pachymeningitis is a notable rarity. Case Report A 26-year-old patient presented to the emergency department with acute onset, recurrent episodes of occipital headaches spreading over the whole cranium and vomiting without food consumption, for three days. The clinical examination did not reveal any neurological deficits. The laboratory exams showed no pathological findings. A CT examination with angiography did not detect any acute intracranial or vessel pathology. A lumbar puncture was performed to rule out subarachnoid hemorrhage. The results showed a lymphocytic pleocytosis of 400/ÂµL, elevated protein levels of 1077Â mg/dL and reduced glucose levels (CSF: 55Â mg/dL, Serum: 118Â mg/dL). Extensive infectiological examinations did not reveal any signs of infection, including Borrelia spp. and M. tuberculosis. No positive auto-antibodies or vasculitis-related auto-antibodies were detected. The CSF analysis showed negative oligoclonal bands but an isolated increase in Î²2-microglobulin, neopterin, and IL-2R levels. The MRI examination revealed a dural gadolinium-enhancement, pronounced in the basal cerebral structures and the upper segment of the cervical spine, consistent with neurosarcoidosis. Corticosteroid treatment rapidly led to a significant improvement of the symptoms. No systemic manifestations of sarcoidosis were found.

Her condition rapidly developed into stuporous and hemodynamic instability within serval hours. Veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was rapidly initiated with other supportive treatments. The following-up MRI showed bilateral, symmetrically distributed lesions in the brainstem, bilateral hippocampal regions, and bilateral basal ganglia, consistent with ANE. The diagnosis was confirmed through the detection of SARS-CoV-2 and the exclusion of other potential causes. After weeks of medical treatment, her condition stabilized, and she was transferred for further rehabilitation treatment. Conclusions This case study indicates that COVID-19 may simultaneously and rapidly affect the central nervous system and cardiovascular system, leading to poor outcomes.

This report presents the case of a patient who developed PML due to SLE-associated multiple factors. A 60-year-old woman diagnosed with SLE undergoing multiple immunosuppressive therapies, including azathioprine, presented with cerebral cortical symptoms, lymphocytopenia, and vitamin B12 deficiency and was subsequently diagnosed with SLE-associated PML. We evaluated the cause and disease activity of PML, focusing on the longitudinal assessment of lymphocytopenia, JC virus (JCV) DNA copy number in the cerebrospinal fluid, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings. Discontinuing azathioprine and initiating alternative immunosuppressive treatments with intramuscular vitamin B12 injections affected lymphocytopenia and disease management. However, despite recovery from lymphopenia and JCV DNA copy number being low, the large hyperintense and punctate lesions observed on the fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images exhibited varying behaviors, indicating that the balance between contributing factors for PML may have fluctuated after the initial treatment. Clinicians should be meticulous when assessing the underlying pathology of the multifactorial causes of PML due to SLE. The difference in the transition pattern of these lesions on FLAIR images may be one of the characteristics of MRI findings in PML associated with SLE, reflecting fluctuations in disease activity and the progression stage of PML.',\n",

Patients who suffer from both conditions can be challenging cases for clinicians, as clinical symptoms and radiological findings may overlap, while MS immune-modifying treatments could further increase the risk of oncogenesis. Case Presentation In this study, we describe the case of a 27-year-old woman who presented with signs and symptoms of optic neuritis and was then diagnosed with both MS and NF1. As the patient continued to experience MS relapses despite initial interferon-beta treatment, she was subsequently switched to natalizumab and responded well. Conclusion This case illustrates how MRI lesion differentiation with the co-existence of MS and NF1 can be difficult due to overlaps in lesion characteristics, while treatment decisions can be challenging mainly due to scarce data on the oncogenic risk of MS immunomodulary therapies. Therefore, clinicians need to balance out the risk of malignancy development with the risk of progressive neurological disability when treating such patients.',\n",
       " 'Sensory integration is the province of the parietal lobe. The non-dominant hemisphere is responsible for both body sides, while the dominant hemisphere is responsible for the contralateral hemi-body. Furthermore, the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) participates in a network involved in spatial orientation, attention, and spatial and episodic memory. Laser interstitial thermotherapy (LiTT) is a minimally invasive surgery for focal drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) that can target deeper brain regions, and thus, region-specific symptoms can emerge. Here, we present an 18-year-old right-handed male with focal DRE who experienced seizures characterized by sensations of dÃ©jÃ vu, staring spells, and language disruption. A comprehensive evaluation localized the seizure focus and revealed a probable focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) in the left posterior cingulate gyrus. The patient underwent uneventful LiTT of the identified lesion. Post-operatively, he developed transient ipsilateral spatial neglect and contralateral sensory loss, as well as acalculia. His sensory symptoms gradually improved after the surgery, and he remained seizure-free after the intervention for at least 10 months (until the time of this writing). This rare case of ipsilateral spatial and visual hemineglect post-LiTT in epilepsy underscores the importance of recognizing atypical neurosurgical outcomes and considering individual variations in brain anatomy and function. Understanding the dynamics of cortical connectivity and handedness, particularly in pediatric epilepsy, may be crucial in anticipating and managing neurocognitive effects following epilepsy surgery.',\n",

Case presentation A 42-year-old male with occulted CMT neuropathy type lA (CMT1A) who developed limb numbness and weakness after the second SARS-CoV-2-vaccination was confirmed by identifying characteristic repeats in the p11.2 region of chromosome 17. Due to the progressive deterioration of muscle strength over 8â\\x80\\x89weeks, limb atrophy, moderately elevated protein counts in the cerebrospinal fluid, and significant improvement with intravenous human immunoglobulin, which were characteristic of acquired inflammatory neuropathies, he was eventually diagnosed with CIDP superimposed on CMT1A. However, after a three-month plateau, the patient contracted COVID-19, which led to repeated and worsening symptoms of limb weakness and atrophy, thus was diagnosed with a recurrence of CIDP and treated with Intravenous immunoglobulin and methylprednisolone 500â\\x80\\x89mg/d for 5 consecutive days, followed by oral prednisone and mycophenolate mofetil tablets. On 2â\\x80\\x89month follow-up, he exhibited remarkable clinical improvement and could walk independently with rocking gait. After 1â\\x80\\x89year of follow-up, the patient's condition was stable without further change. Conclusion Our case indicates that CMT1A can deteriorate after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 vaccination should be considered a potential predisposing factor for CMT1A worsening. The possible superposition of CMTIA and CIDP in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection or immunity suggests that any clinical exacerbation in patients with CMT1A should be carefully evaluated to rule out treatable superposition inflammation. In addition, electrophysiological and imaging examination of the proximal nerves, such as the axillary nerve, is helpful for the diagnosis of CIDP.\",\n",

       " 'Background Central neuropathic pain after foramen magnum decompression (FMD) for Chiari malformation type 1 (CM-1) with syringomyelia can be residual and refractory. Here we present a case of refractory central neuropathic pain after FMD in a CM-1 patient with syringomyelia who achieved improvements in pain following spinal cord stimulation (SCS) using fast-acting sub-perception therapy (FASTâ\\x84¢). Case presentation A 76-year-old woman presented with a history of several years of bilateral upper extremity and chest-back pain. CM-1 and syringomyelia were diagnosed. The pain proved drug resistant, so FMD was performed for pain relief. After FMD, magnetic resonance imaging showed shrinkage of the syrinx. Pain was relieved, but bilateral finger, upper arm and thoracic back pain flared-up 10 months later. Due to pharmacotherapy resistance, SCS was planned for the purpose of improving pain. A percutaneous trial of SCS showed no improvement of pain with conventional SCS alone or in combination with Contourâ\\x84¢, but the combination of FASTâ\\x84¢ and Contourâ\\x84¢ did improve pain. Three years after FMD, percutaneous leads and an implantable pulse generator were implanted. The program was set to FASTâ\\x84¢ and Contourâ\\x84¢. After implantation, pain as assessed using the McGill Pain Questionnaire and visual analog scale was relieved even after reducing dosages of analgesic. No adverse events were encountered.

       " 'Abstract Objectives Neurogenic muscle hypertrophy (NMH) is a rare condition characterized by focal muscle hypertrophy caused by chronic partial nervous injury. Given its infrequency, underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Inspired by two clinical cases, we conducted a systematic review to gain insights into the different aspects of NMH. Methods We systematically searched online databases up until May 30, 2023, for reports of muscle hypertrophy attributed to acquired neurogenic factors. We conducted an exploratory analysis to identify commonly associated features. We also report two representative clinical cases. Results Our search identified 63 reports, describing 93 NMH cases, to which we added our two cases. NMH predominantly affects patients with compressive radiculopathy (68.4%), negligible muscular weakness (93.3%), and a chronic increase in muscle bulk. A striking finding in most neurophysiological studies (60.0%) is profuse spontaneous discharges, often hindering the analysis of voluntary traces. Some patients exhibited features consistent with more significant muscle damage, including higher creatine phosphokinase levels, muscle pain, and inflammatory muscle infiltration. These patients are sometimes referred to in literature as \"focal myositis.\" Treatment encompassed corticosteroid, Botulinum Toxin A, decompressive surgery, antiepileptic medications, and nerve blocks, demonstrating varying degrees of efficacy. Botulinum Toxin A yielded the most favorable response in terms of reducing spontaneous discharges. Interpretation This systematic review aims to provide a clear description and categorization of this uncommon presentation of an oftenâ\\x80\\x90overlooked neurological disorder. Though questions remain about the underlying mechanism, evidence suggests that aberrant fiber overstimulation along with increased workload that promotes focal damage may result in muscle hypertrophy. This may serve as a guide for therapeutic interventions.',\n",

Methods We longitudinally readministered validated metrics to track disease course and treatment responses in a previously healthy woman with acute, postinfectious, skin biopsy-confirmed, idiopathic SFN. Results During 5 years, viral respiratory infections triggered 3 separated episodes of acute, disabling burning hand, foot, and face pain (erythromelalgia). The initial 2 resolved with high-dose prednisone, and the third responded to repeated immunoglobulin treatments. Pregnancy with miscarriage triggered a fourth exacerbation refractory to corticosteroids and cyclosporin. Immunoglobulins restored total remission for 2 months; then, 2 rituximab doses slightly improved later flaring. Subsequently, daratumumab initiated 100-day remission later maintained by belimumab, initiated to permit another pregnancy. Remission continued after gestational week 13 all-treatment withdrawal. A week 30 fifth flare responded to plasmapheresis, with healthy birth at week 40. At 11-week postpartum, as symptoms returned, restarting belimumab restored remission maintained during â\\x89¥19 months of breastfeeding. Discussion This decade of tracking characterizes a relapsing-remitting course of SFN with initially separated monophasic episodes becoming more confluent, as with multiple sclerosis. This tempo and responsiveness to 5 immunotherapies suggest dysimmune causality. Validated metrics helped define the course and track treatment efficacy, particularly during pregnancy and breastfeeding.

       " 'Abstract Introduction Emotional apathy has recently been identified as a common symptom of long COVID. While recent meta-analyses have demonstrated generalized EEG slowing with the emergence of delta rhythms in patients hospitalized for severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, no EEG study or dopamine transporter scintigraphy (DaTSCAN) has been performed in patients with long COVID presenting with apathy. The objective of this case report was to explore the pathophysiology of neuropsychological symptoms in long COVID. Case Presentation A 47-year-old patient who developed a long COVID with prominent apathy following an initially clinically mild SARS-CoV-2 infection underwent neuropsychological assessment, cerebral MRI, DaTSCAN, and resting-state high-density EEG 7 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The EEG data were compared to those of 21 healthy participants. The patient presented with apathy, cognitive difficulties with dysexecutive syndrome, moderate attentional and verbal episodic memory disturbances, and resolution of premorbid mild gaming disorder, mild mood disturbances, and sleep disturbances. His MRI and DaTSCAN were unremarkable. EEG revealed a complex pattern of oscillatory abnormalities compared to the control group, with a strong increase in whole-scalp delta and beta band activity, as well as a decrease in alpha band activity. Overall, these effects were more prominent in the frontal-central-temporal region. Conclusion These results suggest widespread changes in EEG oscillatory patterns in a patient with long COVID characterized by neuropsychological complications with prominent apathy. Despite the inherent limitations of a case report, these results suggest dysfunction in the cortical networks involved in motivation and emotion.',\n",

A 39-year-old female presented with subacute encephalopathy and progressive ophthalmoplegia. Her MRI revealed T2 hyperintensities involving the mammillary bodies, periaqueductal grey matter, medial thalami, third ventricle, and area postrema. Whole blood thiamine levels were elevated and she did not improve with IV thiamine. CSF was notable for lymphocytic pleocytosis and elevated protein. She tested positive for serum Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody. Subsequent imaging revealed multilevel lesions in the cervical and thoracic spinal cord. Her CSF GFAP antibody also came back positive. She steadily and significantly improved after high-dose IV steroids and plasmapheresis. She later started on chronic rituximab therapy. This represents a unique case of NMOSD presenting with the classical clinical and imaging features of WE, as opposed to the typical presenting symptoms of NMOSD. As such, demyelinating disorders should be considered when there is concern for diencephalic and midline pathologies, particularly without classic WE risk factors.

       " 'Abstract Anticholinergic toxicity is a common occurrence in the emergency room, making it crucial for emergency clinicians to have a good understanding of this toxidrome. The neuropsychiatric effects of anticholinergic agents and anabolic steroids (ASs) can manifest as symptoms like anxiety, agitation, dysarthria, confusion, seizures, visual hallucinations, bizarre behavior, delirium, psychosis, and coma. When dealing with a conscious patient who has ingested an anticholinergic substance, a detailed history of ingestion can aid clinicians in making an accurate diagnosis. However, the lack of information about the substances consumed can complicate diagnosis. In cases where the exposure is unknown, clinicians should consider anticholinergic poisoning in patients showing signs of altered mental status and physical examination findings consistent with anticholinergic toxicity. We report four cases presenting a range of symptoms, including neuropsychiatric manifestations, following the ingestion of the same bodybuilding powders with anticholinergic properties. All four patients consumed yellow and white powders at the same time and in the same place. Laboratory analysis revealed that yellow powder and white powder contained ASs and cyproheptadine, respectively. Anticholinergic toxicity is a frequently encountered condition in the emergency room. Anticholinergic drugs, used as muscle relaxants, compete with acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors in the body.

We report a rare case of a brain metastasis with unique radiologic and histopathologic features in a patient with low grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (LGFMS) previously treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy. The lone metastasis progressed in the midbrain tegmentum over 15 months as a non-enhancing, T2-hyperintense lesion with peripheral diffusion restriction, mimicking a demyelinating lesion. Histopathology of the lesion at autopsy revealed a rich infiltrate of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) with highest density at the leading edge of the metastasis, whereas there was a paucity of lymphocytes, suggestive of an immunologically cold environment. Given the important immunosuppressive and tumor-promoting functions of TAMs in gliomas and carcinoma/melanoma brain metastases, this unusual case provides an interesting example of a dense TAM infiltrate in a much rarer sarcoma brain metastasis.',\n",

       " \"Focal muscle vibration (FMV) is increasingly being recognized as a rehabilitative therapy for enhancing motor function in central nervous system (CNS) diseases, particularly in patients with fine motor control deficits stemming from CNS damage. Brain lesions from these diseases disrupt the motor networks, necessitating novel rehabilitation strategies. By applying vibrations to muscles, FMV stimulates sensory fibers to induce cortical activity and kinesthetic illusions. While initial studies have highlighted FMV's role in reducing spasticity, recent evidence points to its potential in treating motor paralysis. However, prior research has been limited by the lack of acute-phase studies and a focus on patients with minimal muscle contraction capability. This report aimed to explore FMV's efficacy on upper limb motor function in patients with flaccid motor paralysis immediately after acute CNS diseases. We report the case of a septuagenarian male with a brain abscess in the right parietal lobe, leading to flaccid motor paralysis. Rehabilitation included 28 sessions of occupational and physical therapy that incorporated FMV. Significant improvements were observed in upper extremity function, with moderate to very large effect sizes, while lower limb function showed lesser improvement without adverse effects. This case suggests the utility of FMV in enhancing upper-limb motor function after acute CNS injuries, potentially serving as a supplementary therapy for spontaneous recovery.

The patient came back 4 weeks after the diagnosis to the emergency department with massive bilateral pulmonary embolism with syncope at onset, acute cardiorespiratory failure, deep left femoral-popliteal vein thrombophlebitis, and altered neurological status. In the intensive care unit, he received mechanical ventilation through intubation. Significant improvement was seen after 2 weeks.

At 6 months of follow-up, ECG-Holter monitoring and MRI brain images remained unchanged. However, after 3 months, the patient died suddenly while sleeping at home. Conclusion The genetic tests performed on KSS patients should also include those for inherited thrombophilia. By detecting these mutations, we can prevent major complications such as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, coronary accidents, or sudden death.',\n",
       " 'Lesions at the cerebellopontine angle (CP angle) are associated with various brain-heart interactions, which can include those from stimulation of the fifth cranial nerve along the scalp incision in a retrosigmoid suboccipital surgical approach. A 27-year-old male patient with recently diagnosed hypertension (on calcium channel blocker) underwent left CP angle lesion decompression. Transient episodes of bradycardia, hypotension, and bradypnea were observed from the skin incision onward, exacerbated during tumor manipulation. Most episodes subsided with cessation of the surgical stimulus while some required intervention. Postoperatively, blood pressure decreased below the pre-operative levels. Thus, trigeminocardiac reflex can occur as early as the skin incision even in a retrosigmoid approach due to stimulation of the mandibular division, when specific risk factors exist. Such episodes may serve as early warning signs for subsequent intraoperative occurrences. Brainstem compression can be a possible etiology of hypertension in young patients.

Lesions in the midbrain can cause disconjugate eye movements. While vertically disconjugate eye movements have been linked to defective visuo-vestibular integration, the pathophysiology and neuroanatomy of horizontally disconjugate eye movements remains elusive. Methods A patient with a solitary focal midbrain lesion was examined using detailed clinical ocular motor assessments, binocular videooculography and diffusion-weighted MRI, which was co-registered to a high-resolution cytoarchitectonic MR-atlas. Results The patient exhibited both vertically and horizontally disconjugate eye alignment and nystagmus. Binocular videooculography showed a strong correlation of vertical and horizontal oscillations during fixation but not in darkness. Oscillation intensities and waveforms were modulated by fixation, illumination, and gaze position, suggesting shared visual- and vestibular-related mechanisms. The lesion was mapped to a functionally ill-defined area of the dorsal midbrain, adjacent to the posterior commissure and sparing nuclei with known roles in vertical gaze control. Conclusion A circumscribed region in the dorsal midbrain appears to be a key node for disconjugate eye movements in both vertical and horizontal planes. Lesioning this area produces a unique ocular motor syndrome mirroring hallmarks of developmental strabismus and nystagmus. Further circuit-level studies could offer pivotal insights into shared pathomechanisms of acquired and developmental disorders affecting eye alignment.

Thalamic Ventral-Oralis (VO) complex and Zona Incerta (ZI) are emerging targets for tremor control in various etiologies. Objective To report on neuroradiological, neurophysiological targeting and long-term efficacy of thalamic Ventral-Oralis complex and Zona Incerta deep brain stimulation in Midline Tremor. Methods Three patients (two males and one female) with Midline Tremor in dystonic syndromes were recruited for this open-label study. Clinical, surgical, neurophysiological intraoperative testing and long-term follow-up data are reported. Results Intraoperative testing and reconstruction of volume of tissue activated confirmed the position of the electrodes in the area stimulated between the thalamic Ventral-Oralis complex and Zona Incerta in all patients. All three patients showed optimal control of both tremor and dystonic features at short-term (6Â months) and long-term follow-up (up to 6Â years). No adverse events occurred. Conclusion In the syndromes of Midline Tremor of various origins, the best target for DBS might be difficult to identify. Our results showed that thalamic Ventral-Oralis complex/Zona Incerta may be a viable and safe option even in specific forms of tremor with axial distribution.

       " 'Background Cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy and vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS), a relatively common cause of late-onset progressive ataxia, is a genetic disease characterised by biallelic pentanucleotide AAGGG repeat expansion in intron 2 of the replication factor complex subunit 1 gene. Herein, we describe the first molecularly confirmed CANVAS family with five affected siblings from Turkey. Case presentation The family comprised seven siblings born from healthy non-consanguineous parents. CANVAS phenotype was present in five of them; two were healthy and asymptomatic. Chronic cough was the first symptom reported in all five siblings, followed by the development of sensory symptoms, oscillopsia and imbalance. Clinical head impulse test (HIT) was positive in all cases and video HIT performed on three patients revealed very low vestibulo-ocular reflex gains bilaterally. Magnetic resonance imaging and nerve conduction studies revealed cerebellar atrophy and sensory neuronopathy, respectively. RP-PCR confirmed the homozygous presence of the AAGGG repeat expansion in all five cases. Conclusion Genetic screening for CANVAS should be considered in all patients with late-onset ataxia, sensory disturbances and vestibular involvement, especially in the presence of chronic cough.

We report a case of fatigable ptosis and complex ophthalmoplegia in brainstem uraemic encephalopathy. Case presentation A 22-year-old Sri Lankan man with end stage renal failure presented with acute onset diplopia and drooping of eyelids progressively worsening over one week. The patient had not complied with the prescribed renal replacement therapy which was planned to be initiated 5Â months previously. On examination, his Glasgow coma scale score was 15/15, He had a fatigable asymmetrical bilateral ptosis. The ice-pack test was negative. There was a complex ophthalmoplegia with bilateral abduction failure and elevation failure of the right eye. The diplopia did not worsen with prolonged stare. The rest of the neurological examination was normal. Serum creatinine on admission was 21.81Â mg/dl. The repetitive nerve stimulation did not show a decremental pattern. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain demonstrated diffuse midbrain and pontine oedema with T2 weighted/FLAIR hyperintensities. The patient was haemodialyzed on alternate days and his neurological deficits completely resolved by the end of the second week of dialysis. The follow up brain MRI done two weeks later demonstrated marked improvement of the brainstem oedema with residual T2 weighted/FLAIR hyperintensities in the midbrain. Conclusions Uraemia may rarely cause an isolated brainstem encephalopathy mimicking ocular myasthenia, which resolves with correction of the uraemia.

       " \"Current preoperative evaluation of epilepsy can be challenging due to the lack of a comprehensive view of the network's dysfunctions. To demonstrate the utility of our multi-modal neurophysiology and neuroimaging integration approach in the pre-surgical evaluation, we present a proof-of-concept for using this approach in a patient with non-lesional frontal lobe epilepsy who underwent two resective surgeries to achieve seizure control. We conducted a post-hoc investigation using four neuroimaging and neurophysiology modalities: diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI), and stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) at rest and during seizures. We computed region-of-interest-based connectivity for each modality and applied betweenness centrality to identify key network hubs across modalities. Our results revealed that despite seizure semiology and sEEG indicating dysfunction in the right orbitofrontal region, the maximum overlap on the hubs across modalities extended to right temporal areas. Notably, the right middle temporal lobe region served as an overlap hub across DTI, rsfMRI, and rest sEEG networks and was only included in the resected area in the second surgery, which led to long-term seizure control of this patient. Our findings demonstrated that trans-modal hubs could help identify key areas related to epileptogenic network. Therefore, this case presents a promising perspective of using a multi-modal approach to improve the pre-surgical evaluation of patients with epilepsy.\",\n",

       " \"We present an in-depth clinical and neuroimaging analysis of a family carrying the MAPT K298E mutation associated with frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Initial identification of this mutation in a single clinical case led to a comprehensive investigation involving four affected siblings allowing to elucidate the mutation's phenotypic expression. A 60-year-old male presented with significant behavioral changes and progressed rapidly, exhibiting speech difficulties and cognitive decline. Neuroimaging via FDG-PET revealed asymmetrical frontotemporal hypometabolism. Three siblings subsequently showed varied but consistent clinical manifestations, including abnormal behavior, speech impairments, memory deficits, and motor symptoms correlating with asymmetric frontotemporal atrophy observed in MRI scans. Based on the genotype–phenotype correlation, we propose that the p.K298E mutation results in early-onset behavioral variant FTD, accompanied by a various constellation of speech and motor impairment. This detailed characterization expands the understanding of the p.K298E mutation's clinical and neuroimaging features, underlining its role in the pathogenesis of FTD.

       " 'Chronic cough in children and adolescents can be troublesome both to the patient and the whole family. The most common causes of chronic cough in children are protracted bacterial bronchitis and bronchial asthma. However, differential diagnostic workup and treatment can become complicated when a cough of different etiology is encountered, especially in a child having a complex medical history for an unrelated pathology. A cough lacking any identified somatic cause and response to medical treatment in combination with core clinical features of tics that include suppressibility, distractibility, suggestibility, variability, and the presence of a premonitory sensation is labeled tic cough. Here we discuss a case of an adolescent who had atrophy of the corpus callosum and a history of ventriculoperitoneal shunting due to hydrocephalus caused by stenosis of the sylvian aqueduct, but now presented with a debilitating dry cough lasting for several months. After physical causes of cough were ruled out, the diagnosis of tic cough was reached, and multidisciplinary treatment ensured complete recovery. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case showing coincidence of tic cough and hydrocephalus. The co-occurrence of non-syndromic corpus callosum atrophy and tic cough might hypothetically suggest a predisposing pathogenetic link via reduced signaling through cortical inhibitory neurons; further studies are needed. The importance of careful assessment of medical history, clinical picture, and features of the cough itself are emphasized in order to reach the correct diagnosis. Increased awareness of medical society is mandatory to recognize tic cough and to distinguish it from the neurologic manifestations of organic brain pathology.',\n",

       " 'Background Bibrachial amyotrophy associated with an extradural CSF collection and infratentorial superficial siderosis (SS) are rare conditions that may occasionally mimic ALS. Both disorders are assumed to be due to dural tears. Case presentation A 53-year-old man presented with a 7-year history of slowly progressive asymmetric bibrachial amyotrophy. Initially, a diagnosis of atypical motor neuron disease (MND) was made. At re-evaluation 11 years later, upper limb wasting and weakness had further progressed and were accompanied by sensorineural hearing loss. MRI of the brain and spine demonstrated extensive supra- and infratentorial SS (including the surface of the whole spinal cord) as well as a ventral longitudinal intraspinal fluid collection (VLISFC) extending along almost the entire thoracic spine. Osteodegenerative changes were observed at C5-C7 level, with osteophytes protruding posteriorly. The bony spurs at C6-C7 level were hypothesized to have lesioned the dura, causing a CSF leak and thus a VLISFC. Review of the MRI acquired at first evaluation showed that the VLISFC was already present at that time (actually beginning at C7 level), whereas the SS was not. 19 years after the onset of upper limb weakness, the patient additionally developed parkinsonism. Response to levodopa, brain scintigraphy with 123 Conclusions Based on the long-term follow-up, we could establish that, while the evidence of the VLISFC was concomitant with the clinical presentation of upper limb amyotrophy and weakness, the radiological signs of SS appeared later. This suggests that SS was not per se the cause of the ALS-like clinical picture, but rather a long-term sequela of a dural leak. The latter was instead the causative lesion, giving rise to a VLISFC which compressed the cervical motor roots. Dural tears can actually cause several symptoms, and further studies are needed to elucidate the pathophysiological correlates of \"duropathies\". Finally, as iron metabolism has been implicated in PD, the co-occurrence of PD with SS deserves further investigation.',\n",

       " 'Simple Summary There are many potential benefits of obtaining a genetic diagnosis for an adult diagnosed with a neuromuscular disorder. However, not all patients with neuromuscular disorders will be offered broad genetic testing to identify a genetic cause. Here, we use five case examples to illustrate why it is important for adult neuromuscular clinics to offer broad-based genetic testing to their patients. For each case example, we describe why broad genetic testing was better suited to detect the genetic cause of the condition, including a description of the genetic change identified and the resulting biological implication, as well as the clinical and personal outcomes of the genetic diagnosis for the patient. Our findings highlight the crucial role of broad genetic testing in the management of adults with neuromuscular disorders. Abstract Advances in gene-specific therapeutics for patients with neuromuscular disorders (NMDs) have brought increased attention to the importance of genetic diagnosis. Genetic testing practices vary among adult neuromuscular clinics, with multi-gene panel testing currently being the most common approach; follow-up testing using broad-based methods, such as exome or genome sequencing, is less consistently offered. Here, we use five case examples to illustrate the unique ability of broad-based testing to improve diagnostic yield, resulting in identification of SORD- HADHB ATXN2 MECP2 DNMT1',\n",

However, intraoperative neurological monitoring in pregnant women is challenging, as the anesthesia management must consider the effects and risks to the fetus. Remimazolam is a newly introduced intravenous anesthetic that has little effect on blood pressure. However, the effects of remimazolam on intraoperative neuromonitoring are little known. We treated a pregnant patient with parasellar meningioma who developed visual impairment, using remimazolam for anesthesia and intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring of the visual evoked potential. Case presentation A 34-year-old woman who was 20 weeks pregnant presented with visual acuity disturbances. Neuroimaging demonstrated a parasellar meningioma, and rapid tumor growth and worsening of symptoms subsequently occurred. Craniotomy for tumor removal was performed under anesthesia with remimazolam, which allowed monitoring of the visual evoked potentials. Her visual acuity was restored postoperatively, and no adverse events occurred in the fetus. Conclusion Our experience with intraoperative neuromonitoring of a pregnant woman in the third trimester showed that anesthesia with remimazolam allows safe brain surgery combined with intraoperative visual evoked potential monitoring.

Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP) is an immune-mediated polyneuropathy affecting the peripheral nerve roots, which is not well described as a post-vaccination side effect. Here, we present a rare complication of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2, reaching a diagnosis of CIDP. Case presentation A 67-year-old diabetic male presented with lower extremity paresthesia and weakness following the third dose of the Sinopharm (BBIBP-CorV) vaccine. Despite initial dismissal as a diabetic complication, symptoms escalated, affecting all extremities. Electromyography study revealed abnormal spontaneous activity with chronic reinnervation changes, which was more significant in the lower extremities. Based on the clinical course, radiographic imaging, and laboratory data, a diagnosis of CIDP with severe axonal demyelinating features was established. Treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), prednisolone, and azathioprine resulted in marked improvement of the upper extremities but limited recovery in distal lower extremity muscles. Conclusion Although CIDP is a rare complication following COVID-19 vaccination, it should be considered in the differential diagnosis.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed diffuse pachymeningeal enhancement involving the cranial, cervical, thoracic, and lumbar segments with spinal cord compression and cystic lesions. CSF immunology was initially positive for cysticercus cellulosae. Conclusions This case highlights the possibility of IgG4-related disease in patients with diffuse pachymeningitis causing spinal cord compression, even with cystic lesions on MRI. Diagnosis of IgG4-related pachymeningitis is paramount due to the possibility of treatment response to immunotherapy, particularly to anti-CD20 agents.',\n",
       " 'Brain metastases in prostate cancer are rare (<2% of cases). In magnetic resonance imaging, nearly all brain metastases exhibit contrast-enhancement, which may be affected by the time elapsed since the administration of the contrast agent. We discuss a case where the brain metastases in a patient with prostate cancer do not show a clear contrast-enhancement on magnetic resonance imaging using a standard brain metastases protocol. It also emphasizes the usefulness of delayed imaging in identifying blood–brain barrier damage. We present the case of a 69-year-old man diagnosed with prostate adenocarcinoma, currently in castration-resistant phase (last value of serum prostate-specific antigen: 45.1Â ng/mL) with bone, mediastinal and inguinal lymph nodes, pulmonary, and hepatic metastases. In a contrast-enhanced whole-body computed tomography examination, the appearance of intra-axial brain lesions suspicious for metastases was documented. The subsequent contrast-enhanced brain magnetic resonance imaging showed the presence of 5 intra-axial lesions consistent with brain metastases. These lesions exhibited hyperintense signals in T2-fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images; after contrast agent administration, a ring-like contrast-enhancement was more clearly visible in T1-weighted images acquired later (about 15 minutes after contrast agent administration) than in those acquired earlier (about 5-7 minutes after contrast agent administration). In conclusion, for oncological subjects with multiple brain lesions lacking obvious contrast-enhancement using a standard magnetic resonance imaging protocol, we suggest acquiring late images. These might allow for the detection of even minimal post-contrast impregnation, improving confidence in the diagnosis of brain metastases.',\n",

These pathogenic variants account for 90% of LHON cases, with rare pathogenic variants accounting for the remaining cases. We report the first Japanese case of LHON with the m.13051â\\x80\\x89G>A pathogenic variant, which is a rare primary pathogenic variant of LHON. A 24-year-old woman developed subacute visual loss in both eyes over several months. The best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 6/120 in her right eye (OD) and 6/7.5 in her left eye (OS). A relative afferent pupillary defect was not detected. Humphrey visual field testing revealed a central scotoma OD and a temporal paracentral scotoma OS. Fundus examination showed the presence of a pale optic disc OD and optic disc swelling with peripapillary microangiopathy OS. Orbital magnetic resonance imaging showed no abnormal findings. As the mitochondrial DNA gene testing demonstrated the m.13051â\\x80\\x89G>A pathogenic variant, the patient was diagnosed with LHON. Subsequently, her BCVA worsened to 6/600 in each eye, followed by a nearly plateau-like progression thereafter. This mutation has been primarily reported in Europe but has not yet been confirmed in the Asian region. This case also indicates the importance of examining the whole mitochondrial DNA gene for pathogenic variants in cases where one of the three major pathogenic variants has not been not detected.\",\n",

It has not previously been described as a neurologic immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-related adverse event (nirAE) or in association with esophageal adenocarcinoma. Methods We describe a 61-year-old man with metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma treated with folinic acid, fluorouracil, oxaliplatin (FOLFOX), and nivolumab, who subsequently developed diplopia, vertigo, and progressive gait ataxia after 8 weeks of treatment. Results Owing to a concern for ICI-associated myasthenia gravis, nivolumab was held and he was treated with prednisone and pyridostigmine. EMG showed no neuromuscular junction dysfunction, and acetylcholine-receptor antibodies were negative. Brain MRI was unrevealing. Murine brain tissue immunofluorescence assay revealed KLHL11-IgG in both serum and CSF, confirmed by cell-based assay. Tumor histopathology demonstrated poorly differentiated, highly proliferative adenocarcinoma with increased mitotic figures and cytoplasmic KLHL11 immunoreactivity. He was initiated on 6 months of cyclophosphamide in addition to FOLFOX for post-ICI–associated KLHL11-IgG rhombencephalitis. Discussion We report KLHL11-IgG rhombencephalitis associated with poorly differentiated esophageal cancer as a novel nirAE. Tumor staining revealed KLHL11 immunoreactivity, supporting a cancer-antigen–driven ICI-associated paraneoplastic syndrome. Recognition of novel nirAEs can expedite treatment and potentially prevent progressive neurologic disability.',\n",

This glioneuronal tumor mainly affects the supratentorial area in children and recurrently presents with a monosomy of chromosome 14. Herein, we report the case of a DNA-methylation based diagnosis of DGONC having atypical features, such as pseudo-rosettes and the absence of a chromosome 14 monosomy, thus rendering its diagnosis very challenging. Because of the wide variety of morphologies harbored by DGONC, a large range of differential diagnoses may be hypothesized from benign to malignant. Interestingly, the current case, like one previously reported, exhibited a co-expression of OLIG2, synaptophysin and SOX10, without GFAP immunopositivity. This particular immunophenotype seems to be a good indicator for a DGONC diagnosis. The classification of DGONC amongst glioneuronal or embryonal tumors is still debated. The clinical (a pediatric supratentorial tumor), morphological (from a benign oligodendroglioma-like tumor with microcalcifications and possible neuropil-like islands to a malignant embryonal tumor with a possible spongioblastic pattern), and immunohistochemical (co-expression of OLIG2 and synaptophsyin) profiles resemble CNS, neuroblastoma, FOXR2-',\n",

Methods Neurotypical children aged 10–15 participated in the study. All subjects were assessed using the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia Present and Lifetime Version Korean Version (K-SADS-PL-K) and confirmed to have no psychiatric symptoms. The participants were randomly assigned to the MNF active (N=31) or sham control (N=30) groups. The MNF program was administered using a mobile app for 30 min/day, 3 days/week, for 3 months. All participants and their parents completed self-report scales and participants complete neurocognitive function assessments including the continuous performance test, Stroop, children's color trails test-1 and 2, and intelligence test at baseline and after the 3-month MNF program. Results This study involved 61 participants (mean [SD] age, 11.24 [1.84] years; 30 male participants [49.2%]). To verify the difference between the MNF group and the sham group, 2(MNF-Sham) X 2(Pre-Post) repeated measures ANOVA was performed. The main effect of the K-scale (Korea Internet addiction scale) between-group factor (MNF vs Sham) was not significant, but the main effect of the within-group factor (Pre vs Post) was significant (F=7.595, p=0.008). The interaction effect of between-group factors and within-group factors was also significant (F=5.979, p=0.017). In other self-reported scales of children and parents and neurocognitive function assessments, there was no significant difference between the two groups. Conclusion Active mobile neurofeedback significantly improved children's K-scale score compared to the sham group. Therefore, mobile neurofeedback could be an easy-to-access therapeutic option for children at risk of Internet addiction. On the other hand, there was no significant difference in other scales and neurocognitive function. A 3-month intervention may not have been long enough to cause change, so longer interventions are needed for confirmation.\",\n",

Attractive anatomical and functional targets for stereotactic surgery are reported in some studies. Surgery for treatment of psychiatric conditions in our nation and Arab world is obscured and hidden because of several social and cultural limitations, which should be overcome. We report here the first psychiatric neurosurgery in our nation and how we overcome such community limitation. This the first report of postoperative tremor. Case Presentation Young patient presented with severe and persistent obsessive-compulsive disorder resistant to all non-surgical modalities for several years. Stereotactic ablation surgery was done under local anaesthesia. Marked improvement in our obsessive-compulsive disorder patient after psychiatric neurosurgery with self-limited tremor was not reported before in the literature. The medications were the same before and immediate after surgery and this is not a drug-induced tremor. Postoperative YBOCS showed 90% of improvement. Conclusion Surgery-induced tremor could be a self-limited side effect after surgery in obsessive-compulsive disorder. Safety and efficacy should be promoted in our nation and Arab world. Society and cultural limitations should be overcome by further research studies, intervention, and activism in the field of mental health systems in our nation and Arab countries to improve awareness.',\n",
       " 'The objective is to investigate the presentation, complications, management, and outcomes of copper deficiency-induced neurological pathologies due to Wilson disease (WD) overtreatment. We examined the case of a WD patient who developed a low thoracic dorsal myelopathy due to chronic hypocupremia from excessive zinc therapy. A comprehensive literature review was conducted to identify similar cases. Ten additional cases of neurological pathology resulting from copper deficiency in the context of WD over-treatment were identified, all occurring during therapy with zinc salts. Myelopathy and peripheral neuropathy were the most common complications, while two additional groups reported leukoencephalopathy. Early cytopenia was often associated with copper deficiency-related neurological pathology appearing early in the context of copper deficiency. WD patients undergoing treatment, especially with zinc salts, should be closely monitored to prevent over-treatment and the consequent copper deficiency. Regular complete blood counts could provide early detection of copper deficiency, avoiding irreversible neurological damage. Swift recognition of new neurological signs not consistent with WD and timely discontinuation of the decoppering therapy are critical for improving outcomes. The optimal management, including the potential benefit of copper supplementation in patients with WD and subsequent therapy adjustments, remains unclear and necessitates further investigation. Despite the general poor functional neurological outcomes, there were some exceptions that warrant further exploration.',\n",
       " 'Background Chronic lymphoproliferative disorder of natural killer cells (CLPD-NK) is a rare disease characterized by a persistent increase in NK cells in peripheral blood and is generally asymptomatic. If present, symptoms may include fatigue, B symptoms (fever, night sweats, and unintentional weight loss), autoimmune-associated diseases, splenomegaly, and infection due to neutropenia. Peripheral neuropathy, however, is uncommon with an incidence of 3%. Neurolymphomatosis is a neurological manifestation of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and leukemia in which neurotropic neoplastic cells infiltrate the nerves. Moreover, neurolymphomatosis caused by CLPD-NK is extremely rare, with even fewer cases of autonomic dysfunction. We report a case of neurolymphomatosis associated with CLPD-NK and developed autonomic dysfunction, including orthostatic hypotension and gastrointestinal symptoms. Case presentation The patient was a 61-year-old male who was referred to our hospital for leukocytosis. He was diagnosed with CLPD-NK; however, was untreated since he had no hepatosplenomegaly, and other systemic symptoms. He later developed numbness in his lower extremities. Cerebral spinal fluid examination revealed a markedly elevated protein level of 140Â mg/dL, and contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging showed bilateral L4 and 5 nerve roots with enlargement and contrast effect. An immune-mediated polyradiculoneuropathy was suspected, and he was treated with intravenous methylprednisolone and immunoglobulin followed by oral prednisolone and cyclosporine. Although his symptoms were relieved by the immunotherapy, significant autonomic dysfunction, including intractable diarrhea, decreased sweating, and orthostatic hypotension, appeared. Additionally, tests for onconeuronal antibodies, ganglionic nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (gAChR) antibody, NF155, CNTN1, Caspr1 antibody, and anti-ganglioside antibodies were all negative. A sural nerve biopsy revealed lymphocytic infiltration, and immunohistochemical staining of lymphocytes confirmed the infiltration of NK and T cells. Therefore, a diagnosis of neurolymphomatosis caused by CLPD-NK was made, and chemotherapy led to partial symptom improvement. Conclusions We experienced a case of pathologically diagnosed neurolymphomatosis with autonomic dysfunction associated with CLPD-NK. In cases of subacute to chronic autonomic dysfunction, paraneoplastic neuropathy, amyloidosis, and autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy are considered; however neurolymphomatosis caused by CLPD-NK, an important cause of autonomic dysfunction, is not. In difficult to make diagnosis, aggressive nerve biopsy is required.',\n",
       " 'Post–allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) immunosuppression regimens are given as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. Most GVHD prophylaxis regimens are based on calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs). Unfortunately, CNIs are associated with significant associated morbidity, frequently cannot be tolerated, and often need to be discontinued. There is no consensus as to which alternative immunosuppression should be used in cases where CNIs have to be permanently discontinued. Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4-immunoglobulin (CTLA4-Ig) blocking agents are well tolerated and have been used extensively in patients with autoimmune disease and as post-transplant immunosuppression. There are two CTLA4-Ig agents: belatacept and abatacept. Belatacept is routinely used in adult kidney transplantation to prevent rejection and abatacept has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for GVHD prophylaxis in patients undergoing a matched or one allele-mismatched unrelated allogenic HCT. Herein, we describe a case in which abatacept was given off-label to replace tacrolimus GVHD prophylaxis in a patient with neurotoxicity undergoing haploidentical HCT. This case suggests that CTLA4-Ig blockade may be a good alternative to a CNI in cases where the CNI needs to be discontinued and warrants further investigation.',\n",

Optic nerve involvement is frequently observed secondary to uncontrolled glaucoma but, rarely, an ischaemic optic neuropathy can occur. In this case report we describe a patient who presented with bilateral progressive visual loss and constriction of his visual fields. Fundus examination showed intense paleness of both optic discs with elevated, poorly defined margins that seemed to be infiltrated. Fundus autofluorescence and enhanced-depth imaging optical coherence tomography ruled out the presence of optic disc drusen. Orbital magnetic resonance imaging ruled out any sign of orbital compression, inflammation or infiltration of the optic nerve.

The neurocognitive impact of FCCM is still underrecognized. Methods We report the clinical, neurocognitive, imaging and genetic data of a three generation family with FCCM. Results A 63-year-old man (proband) had progressive memory impairment since the last year. Neurologic exam was unremarkable. Brain MRI showed multiple large cavernomas (mainly in the pons, left temporal, and right temporo-parietal) and scattered microhemorrhages. Neuropsychological assessment mainly revealed left frontal and right temporo-parietal dysfunction. A 41-year-old daughter, presented with headache, vertigo and memory complaints in the last 2 years.

       " \"Abstract The first author is a left-handed, 51-year-old nephrologist who experienced a neurologic event. She underwent neurosurgery complicated by hemorrhage. Postoperatively, she developed persistent vertigo and unilateral tongue pain which persisted for over 5 years. Early neuroimaging revealed expected encephalomalacia but no neuroanatomical basis for her symptoms. A functional neurological disorder was suspected, and she was seen by several psychiatrists and psychotherapists. However, she suspected a neuroanatomical lesion would better explain her unrelenting symptoms. After seeing many neurologists, a neuroanatomical diagnosis was finally made. The theory and practice of medicine mandate that subjective complaint guides the modality and interpretation of objective evidence. The final neurologist knew where on neuroimaging to look because she was guided by the patient's complaints – vertigo and unilateral tongue pain. In this case, detailed scrutiny of neuroimaging by a neurologist, after encephalomalacia and gliosis were fully completed, gave a more accurate neuroanatomical diagnosis and a more realistic prognosis.\",\n",

A 45-year-old man with a history of ulcerative colitis (UC) taking mesalazine (5-aminosalicylic acid) visited the emergency room presenting with ataxia, ophthalmoplegia and a progressively worsening cognitive impairment. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed mild elevation in protein and white blood cell count and increased intracranial pressure. Anti-GQ1b autoantibodies were found positive in the patient's serum and contrast-enhanced brain magnetic resonance imaging showed diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement and pontine lesions. Based on these findings and the patient's clinical course and history, he was diagnosed with Bickerstaff's brainstem encephalitis. Mesalazine was discontinued and high-dose steroid pulse therapy was started, followed by intravenous immunoglobulin, which resulted in gradual improvement of the neurologic symptoms. When an ulcerative colitis patient presents with progressive cognitive impairment, quadriplegia and disturbance of consciousness and gait, Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis should be considered in the differential diagnosis and prompt immunotherapy may lead to favorable prognosis.\",\n",
       " \"Background Recent evidence suggests that the failure of the glymphatic system – the brain's waste clearance system, which is active during sleep – plays a key role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Glymphatic function can be investigated using serial MRIs after intrathecal gadobutrol injection. This technique can reveal the health of the glymphatic system, but has not yet been used in participants with cognitive impairment due to AD. Case report This report describes the sleep and gadobutrol tracer clearance patterns of four participants diagnosed with mild to moderate cognitive impairment with evidence of AD pathology (pathological levels of Ab and p-tau in cerebrospinal fluid). We performed polysomnography and MRI studies before tracer injection and MRI scans at 1.5-2Â h, 5–6Â h, and 48Â h after injection. Despite participants reporting no sleep problems, polysomnography revealed that all participants had moderate to severe sleep disturbances, including reduced sleep efficiency during the study and obstructive sleep apnea. Severe side-effects related to tracer administration were observed, impeding the completion of the protocol in two participants. Participants who finished the protocol displayed delayed and persistent tracer enrichment in the cortex and white matter, even 48Â h after injection. These outcomes have not been observed in previous studies in participants without AD. Conclusion The findings suggest that brains with sleep impairment and AD pathology have poor glymphatic function, and therefore cannot clear the contrast tracer efficiently. This is likely to have caused the severe side effects in our participants, that have not been reported in healthy individuals. Our results may therefore represent the only available data acquired with this technique in participants with AD pathology.

Introduction Primary neurolymphomatosis (NL) is a critical differential diagnosis of asymmetric multiple mononeuropathy and radiculoplexopathy. Its diagnosis is often challenging due to the lack of typical clinical signs of systemic lymphoma. We report a case of primary NL where nerve ultrasound (NUS) played an important role in the diagnosis and follow-up of the disease. Case presentation A 52-year-old man developed asymmetric painful multiple mononeuropathy in the right upper limb with cranial nerve involvement. After being referred to our department, the patient underwent NUS, which revealed marked enlargement and increased vascularity in the right upper limb nerves, brachial plexus, and cervical nerve roots. Furthermore, an epineural hypoechoic mass, a characteristic finding of NL, was seen in the right median nerve. These NUS findings prompted us to perform 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography and a subsequent biopsy on the right axillary lymph node, confirming NL. Notably, the NUS abnormalities dramatically subsided, demonstrating the effectiveness of chemotherapy. Discussion The diagnostic utility of NUS for NL has been documented by many recent reports. Additionally, NUS can work as a quick follow-up tool for NL, as seen in our case.',\n",

The diagnosis is typically based on clinical triad of ipsilateral facial paralysis, otalgia, and vesicles in the auditory canal or the auricle. However, Ramsay Hunt syndrome may occur without skin eruption in up to oneÂ third of patients. Moreover, the involvement of other cranial nerves in addition to the facial nerve has been also reported. Herein, we reported a case report of a man who developed a multiple cranial neuropathy caused by VZV reactivation without skin vesicular eruption. The present case underlines a possible diagnostic challenge that clinicians may hit when facing a common disorder such as peripheral facial palsy. Indeed, clinicians must be aware that Ramsay Hunt syndrome may develop without skin vesicular eruption as well it may be complicated by multiple cranial nerve involvement.

       " \"Objectives Masitinib, originally developed as a tyrosine kinase inhibitor for cancer treatment, has shown potential neuroprotective effects in various neurological disorders by modulating key pathways implicated in neurodegeneration. This scoping review aimed to summarize the current evidence of masitinib's neuroprotective activities from preclinical to clinical studies. Methods This scoping review was conducted following the guidelines described by Arksey and O'Malley and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The inclusion criteria covered all original studies reporting on the neuroprotective effects of masitinib, including clinical studies, animal studies, and in vitro studies. Results A total of 16 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. These comprised five randomized controlled trials (RCTs), one post-hoc analysis study, one case report, and nine animal studies. The RCTs focused on Alzheimer's disease (two studies), multiple sclerosis (two studies), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (one study). Across all included studies, masitinib consistently demonstrated neuroprotective properties. However, the majority of RCTs reported concerns regarding the safety profile of masitinib. Preclinical studies revealed the neuroprotective mechanisms of masitinib, which include inhibition of certain kinases interfering with cell proliferation and survival, reduction of neuroinflammation, and exhibition of antioxidant activity. Conclusion The current evidence suggests a promising therapeutic benefit of masitinib in neurodegenerative diseases. However, further research is necessary to validate and expand upon these findings, particularly regarding the precise mechanisms through which masitinib exerts its therapeutic effects. Future studies should also focus on addressing the safety concerns associated with masitinib use.\",\n",

Inflammatory brain lesions as \"sentinel lesions\" of PCNSL are very rare. We present a rare case of PCNSL with preceding inflammatory lesions in an immunocompetent patient who underwent two biopsies, one craniotomy and two genetic testing. Case report A 66-year-old male patient presented with left limb weakness and ataxia. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed a contrast-enhancing lesion with perifocal brain edema in the near midline of right frontal lobe. Histological examination of a brain biopsy specimen revealed inflammatory lesion characteristics with infiltration of T-cell dominant lymphocytes and few B-cell. Given that the patient developed cerebral hematoma after biopsy, lesion resection by craniotomy was performed. An excised sample demonstrated mixed T-cell and B-cell infiltrating inflammatory lesions. Four months after total resection of the right frontal lobe lesion, another lesion appeared in the left frontal parietal lobe, which was diagnosed as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma by biopsy. In addition, genetic testing of the lesions at two different locations was performed, and the results showed that the inflammatory lesions had the same three gene (RELN, PCLO, and CREBBP) mutations as PCNSL. Interestingly, the three mutated genes are associated with tumor. Conclusion Our present case is the first to demonstrate inflammatory brain lesions heralding PCNSL from genetic and pathological perspectives. This may help clinicians to select new auxiliary diagnostic methods for timely diagnosis of patients with suspected PCNSL.',\n",

However, the extent of recovery varies depending on the case. Herein, we report the case of a 75-year-old woman with semi-rapidly progressive systemic tremors, visual hallucinations, and irritability. Upon hospitalization, she developed a mild fever and cognitive impairment. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed semi-rapidly progressive diffuse cerebral atrophy (DCA) over 3 months, while no clear abnormal intensities were observed. The nerve conduction study revealed sensory and motor neuropathy in the limbs. The fixed tissue-based assay (TBA) failed to detect antineuronal antibodies; however, based on commercial immunoblots, the presence of anti-AMPH antibodies was suspected. Therefore, serum immunoprecipitation was performed, which confirmed the presence of anti-AMPH antibodies. The patient also had gastric adenocarcinoma. High-dose methylprednisolone, and intravenous immunoglobulin were administered and tumor resection was performed, resulting in resolution of the cognitive impairment and improvement in the DCA on the post-treatment MRI. After immunotherapy and tumor resection, the patient's serum was analyzed using immunoprecipitation, which showed a decrease in the level of anti-AMPH antibodies. This case is noteworthy because the DCA showed improvement after immunotherapy and tumor resection. Additionally, this case demonstrates that negative TBA with positive commercial immunoblots do not necessarily indicate false positive results.\",\n",

A 55-year-old woman presented with a relapsing neurological deficit. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a hemorrhagic right frontal-parietal lesion. When new neurological symptoms occurred, subsequent MRI scans detected more bleeding cerebral lesions. She underwent a series of single hemorrhagic lesion debulking. For any samples that underwent histopathological examination, the first results were not informative; the second and the third results revealed hemangioendothelioma (HE); and the fourth results led to the IPEH diagnosis.

       " 'Introduction: An arteriovenous malformation (AVM) consists of a tangled cluster of dilated blood vessels forming anomalous communication between arterial and venous systems without capillary bridging. The most likely manifestations of a ruptured AVM are intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), or intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH). Subdural hematoma (SDH) is exceptional in cases of ruptured brain arteriovenous malformation (BAVM). Case Report: A 30-year-old female was referred to the Emergency Room with a major complaint of sudden thunderclap headache 1 day before admission. The patient also complained of double vision and left ptosis that lasted for 1 day. There was no other complaint or history of hypertension, diabetes, or trauma. Non-contrast head computed tomography (CT) showed ICH-SAH-SDH on the left side of the brain which was not typical of a hypertensive pattern. The secondary ICH has a score of 6, indicating that 100% of the bleeding might be caused by underlying vascular malformation. Furthermore, cerebral angiography showed cortical plexiform BAVM on the left occipital lobe, and the patient underwent curative embolization. Discussion: Spontaneous SDH is very rare, and there are some hypotheses about the reasons for its occurrence. First, brain movement stretches the arachnoid layer that adheres to the AVM, resulting in direct bleeding into subdural space. Second, high-flow pia-arachnoid ruptured blood might extravasate into subdural space. Finally, the ruptured cortical artery that connects the cortex and dura layer (bridging artery) might also cause SDH. Some scoring systems are useful in BAVM, and this study selected endovascular embolization for the patient. Conclusion: Brain AVM rupture usually causes ICH, SAH, or IVH. Clinicians must be more aware of spontaneous SDH because it might be caused by a vascular malformation, although it is rare.',\n",
       " 'Background and purpose The effects of conventional protocols of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in the chronic phase of stroke are limited. This study aimed to apply the sequential inhibitory and facilitatory rTMS for upper limb motor dysfunction post-stroke to observe the efficacy and explore the possible neurophysiological mechanism. We hypothesize that this protocol would both enhance the excitability of affected M1 and promote connections among motor areas. Case description We reported a 55-year-old female patient with a 1-year chronic stroke and right-sided hemiplegia, who underwent the 14-session rTMS with seven sessions of low frequency (LF) and with seven sessions of high frequency (HF). Clinical scales mainly including Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Upper Extremity (FMA-UE), Action Research Arm Test (ARAT), neurophysiological measures, and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) were assessed before (T0), at the midpoint (T1), and after the intervention (T2). Outcomes The patient exhibited post-intervention improvement in upper extremity function. There was increased excitability in the ipsilesional hemisphere and the opposite in the contralesional hemisphere. The interhemispheric inhibition (IHI) ratio increased from 2.70 to 10.81 and finally decreased to 1.34. Oxy-Hb signal was significantly decreased in affected M1 and mildly decreased in unaffected M1, while that of PMC and SMA on the affected side increased significantly. Conclusion The sequential inhibitory and facilitatory rTMS significantly promoted motor recovery in the patient. Related mechanisms include upregulation of excitability in the ipsilesional hemisphere, return of interhemispheric balance, and neuroplasticity-induced cortical reorganization.',\n",
       " \"Background Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is a rare neurodegenerative illness with characteristic brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) manifestations: diffuse symmetric white-matter hyperintensities in lateral cerebral ventricle areas in fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and high-intensity signals along the corticomedullary junction of the frontal–parietal–temporal lobes in diffusion weighted imaging (DWI). Here, we report a case of adult-onset NIID who was misdiagnosed with Susac syndrome (SS) due to unusual corpus callosum imaging findings. Case presentation A 39-year-old man presented with chronic headache, blurred vision, tinnitus, and numbness in the hands as initial symptoms, accompanied by cognitive slowing and decreased memory. Brain MRI revealed round hypointense lesions on T1-weighted imaging (T1WI) and hyperintense lesions on T2WI/FLAIR/DWI in the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum. An initial diagnosis of SS was made based on the presence of the SS-typical symptoms and SS-characteristic radiology changes. Furthermore, the patient's symptoms improved upon completion of a combined pharmacotherapy plan. However, no significant changes were evident 18â\\x80\\x89months after the brain MRI scan. Eventually, the patient was then diagnosed with NIID based on a skin biopsy and detection of expanded GGC (guanine, guanine, cytosine) repeats in the NOTCH2NLC gene. Conclusion The present NIID case in which there was simultaneous onset of altered nervous and visual system functioning and atypical imaging findings, the atypical imaging findings may reflect an initial change of NIID leukoencephalopathy.\",\n",

Most of the literature has focused on the respiratory manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection in adults, but recent evidence showed that it is not confined to the respiratory tract. This report is about a rare variant of GBS acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN) in a child due to COVID-19 infection An 11 years old boy was referred to the hospital with a history of three-day lasting mild fever, and gastroenteritis, two weeks before starting symptoms. He was presented with progressive ascending weakness, paresthesia, and areflexia in four limbs four days ago. Nasopharyngeal swab polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was positive for SARS-CoV-2. The electrodiagnostic finding was compatible with acute generalized axonal motor neuropathy, and imaging revealed thoracolumbar syrinx and nerve root enhancement in lumbosacral MRI. Other lab tests were normal. GBS and its variant are one of the manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 in children. Children with an unexplained neurological process should be tested for SARS-CoV-2.',\n",
       " \"The obturator nerve originates from the lumbar plexus and innervates sensation in the thigh and movement of the adductor muscle group of the hip. Reports on physical therapy for patients with obturator nerve injuries have been limited due to insufficient injuries, and there have been no reports on rehabilitation after neurotmesis. Furthermore, there are no reports on the status of activities of daily living (ADL) and details of physical therapy in patients with paralysis of the adductor muscle group. In this study, we reported on a patient with adductor paralysis due to obturator neurotmesis, including the clinical symptoms, characteristics of ADL impairment, and effective movement instruction. The patient is a woman in her 40's who underwent laparoscopic total hysterectomy, bilateral adnexectomy, and pelvic lymph node dissection for uterine cancer (grade-2 endometrial carcinoma). During pelvic lymph node dissection, she developed an obturator nerve injury. She underwent nerve grafting during the same surgery by the microsurgeon. Donor nerve was the ipsilateral sural nerve with a 3-cm graft length. Due to obturator nerve palsy, postoperative manual muscle test results were as follows: adductor magnus muscle, 1; pectineus muscle, 1; adductor longs muscle, 0; adductor brevis muscle, 0; and gracilis muscle, 0. On postoperative day 6, the patient could independently perform ADL; however, she was at risk of falling toward the affected side when putting on and taking off her shoes while standing on the affected leg. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 8. Through this case, we clarified the ADL impairment of a patient with adductor muscle palsy following obturator neurotmesis, and motion instruction was effective as physical therapy for this disability. This case suggests that movement instruction is important for acute rehabilitation therapy for patients with hip adductor muscle group with obturator neurotmesis.\",\n",

Further, one large case supports that the COVID-19 vaccine has been reported to result in small fiber neuropathy. We report a case of a patient with confirmed small fiber neuropathy post-COVID-19 vaccination with positive FGFR3 antibodies. The effect of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has been recently explored for treatment of presumed autoimmune small fiber neuropathy.

In this case study, we report a patient with intramedullary abscesses and multiple brain abscesses due to subacute infective endocarditis. Case presentation A 54-year-old man presented with a 7-day history of head and neck pain and numbness in both lower limbs. Intramedullary abscess combined with multiple brain abscesses was diagnosed based on blood culture, head and spinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), contrast-enhanced MRI, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Echocardiography revealed vegetations on the mitral valve and severe mitral regurgitation, which the authors believe was caused by subacute infective endocarditis. With ceftriaxone combined with linezolid anti-infective therapy, the patient's symptoms and imaging was improved during follow-up. Conclusions This case hopes to raise the vigilance of clinicians for ISCA. When considering a patient with an ISCA, it is necessary to complete blood culture, MRI of the brain and spinal cord, and echocardiography to further identify whether the patient also has a brain abscess and whether the cause is infective endocarditis.\",\n",
       " 'Music experience and creation is a complex phenomenon that involves multiple brain structures. Music mapping during awake brain surgery, in addition to standard speech and motor mapping, remains a controversial topic. Music function can be impaired selectively, despite overlap with other neural networks commonly tested during direct cortical stimulation. We describe the case of a 34-year-old male patient presenting with a glioma located within eloquent cortex, who is also a professional musician and actor. We performed an awake craniotomy (AC) that mapped the standard motor and speech areas, while the patient played guitar intraoperatively and sang. Outcomes were remarkable with preservation of function and noted improvements in his musical abilities in outpatient follow-up. In addition, we performed a review of the literature in which awake craniotomies were performed for the removal of brain tumors in patients with some background in music (e.g., score reading, humming/singing). To date, only 4 patients have played a musical instrument intraoperatively during an AC for brain tumor resection. Using awake cortical mapping techniques and paradigms for preserving speech function during an intraoperative musical performance with singing is feasible and can yield a great result for patients. The use of standard brain mapping over music processing mapping did not yield a negative outcome. More experience is needed to understand and standardize this procedure as the field of brain mapping continues to grow for tumor resections.',\n",

Unrecognized throughout his illness, however, was a complaint of intermittent, profuse discharge of clear fluid from his nose that began on the day of the accident and continued up to the time of surgery, after which it was substantially reduced. This outcome reinforces the idea that jugular venous narrowing can cause or perpetuate a cerebrospinal fluid leak. It suggests that the interaction between these two pathological defects may have a profound effect on brain function in the absence of any demonstrable brain lesion. It invites a reevaluation of normal head and neck venous anatomy. It should strike a cautionary note in the diagnosis of functional illness.

       " \"Neuromonitoring is a critical tool for emergency rooms and intensive care units to promptly identify and treat brain injuries. The case report of a patient with status epilepticus necessitating orotracheal intubation and intravenous lorazepam administration is presented. A pattern of epileptiform activity was detected in the left temporal region, and intravenous Acyclovir was administered based on the diagnostic hypothesis of herpetic meningoencephalitis. The neurointensivist opted for multimodal non-invasive bedside neuromonitoring due to the complexity of the patient's condition. A Brain4care (B4C) non-invasive intracranial compliance monitor was utilized alongside the assessment of an optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) and transcranial Doppler (TCD). Based on the collected data, a diagnosis of intracranial hypertension (ICH) was made and a treatment plan was developed. After the neurosurgery team's evaluation, a stereotaxic biopsy of the temporal lesion revealed a grade 2 diffuse astrocytoma, and an urgent total resection was performed. Research suggests that monitoring patients in a dedicated neurologic intensive care unit (Neuro ICU) can lead to improved outcomes and shorter hospital stays. In addition to being useful for patients with a primary brain injury, neuromonitoring may also be advantageous for those at risk of cerebral hemodynamic impairment. Lastly, it is essential to note that neuromonitoring technologies are non-invasive, less expensive, safe, and bedside-accessible approaches with significant diagnostic and monitoring potential for patients at risk of brain abnormalities. Multimodal neuromonitoring is a vital tool in critical care units for the identification and management of acute brain trauma as well as for patients at risk of cerebral hemodynamic impairment.\",\n",

Diffuse axonal injury affecting the corpus callosum may present with intraventricular hemorrhage on baseline computed tomography (CT) scan. Posttraumatic corpus callosum damage is a chronic condition that can be diagnosed over the long term using various magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences. Here, we present two cases of severe survivors of TBI with isolated intraventricular hemorrhage detected on an initial CT scan. After acute trauma management, long-term follow-up was performed. Diffusion tensor imaging and subsequent tractography revealed a significant decrease in the fractional anisotropy values and the number of corpus callosum fibers compared with those in healthy control patients.

With the accepted combination of acupuncture and drugs, the pain was alleviated completely in 8 weeks. Patient 2 (a 64-year-old woman) accepted acupuncture in the absence of medication because of her inability to tolerate the adverse events of anticonvulsant drugs. She achieved remission of pain 4 weeks later.

Methods The patient underwent standardized behavioral and multimodal neuroimaging assessments to monitor clinical evolution and brain function over a 5-month period after presumed intoxication. Results A progressive clinical recovery was observed, from an initial state of coma to emergence from a minimally conscious state after 2 months. Despite the stability of extensive white matter lesions documented by CT and structural MRI, fluorodeoxyglucose PET showed partial recovery of cortical metabolism after 5 months.

Neurosyphilis is classically associated with meningovasculitis in the acute-subacute stage and tabes dorsalis and dementia paralytica in later stages. However, one of the less well described presentations include Guillain–Barre Syndrome. This case presents a patient with an ascending polyneuropathy suspicious for Guillain–Barre Syndrome who also had other atypical findings including a truncal sensory loss, optic disc swelling, and rash ultimately found to have neurosyphilis. Electrodiagnostic testing was consistent with demyelination, supporting a diagnosis of neurosyphilis associated Guillain–Barre Syndrome. Case presentation A 37-year-old female presented to the emergency department with a weakness and difficulty swallowing. She described a three-month history of symptoms, initially starting with a persistent headache followed by one month of a pruritic rash on her chest, palms, and soles. Two weeks prior to presentation, she developed progressive weakness in her arms, numbness in her arms and chest, and difficulty swallowing. Neurological exam was notable for multiple cranial neuropathies, distal predominant weakness in all extremities, length-dependent sensory loss, and hyporeflexia. Investigation revealed a positive Venereal Disease Research Laboratory in her cerebrospinal fluid without significant pleocytosis, contrast enhancement in cranial nerves V, VII, and VIII on MRI, and a demyelinating polyneuropathy on electrodiagnostic testing. She was diagnosed with Guillain–Barre syndrome, secondary to neurosyphilis. The patient acutely declined and required intubation, and ultimately made a full recovery after treatment with plasmapheresis and penicillin. Conclusions This case describes a clinical entity of syphilitic Guillain–Barre Syndrome and highlights the importance of including syphilis in the differential of any patient presenting with ascending polyradiculopathy, especially given the resurgence of syphilis.',\n",

The following case report highlights some of these vital concepts associated with radial artery access, including appropriate patient selection as well as assessment of arterial size in the context of neurointerventional techniques. Early identification of complications such as arterial injury and compartment syndrome, with an emphasis on appropriate draping and inter-procedure monitoring, is discussed as well as approaches for subsequent management.

While HP is usually treated with systemic immunotherapies, response to therapy is variable and may be limited by insufficient drug concentrations in the brain. We report on a 57-year-old patient with HP manifesting with vision and hearing loss who had sustained clinical progression despite various systemic immunotherapies. Intraventricular chemotherapy with methotrexate, cytarabine, and dexamethasone was initiated. We present clinical, imaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings, including cytokine levels before and after intraventricular treatment: rapid decrease of cell count, lactate and profibrotic cytokine levels in the CSF following intraventricular chemotherapy was paralleled by a mild reduction of dura thickness in MRI. The already severely impaired visual acuity and hearing loss did not progress further. Treatment was complicated by exacerbation of previously subtle psychiatric symptoms. Follow-up was terminated after 6 months as the patient suffered from a fatal ischemic stroke. Autopsy revealed neurosarcoidosis as the underlying cause of HP.

We report an autopsy case of an elderly man with brainstem ADEM that progressed over a period of about 3 months. An 82-year-old man developed disturbance of consciousness, dysphagia, and ataxic gait over a period of about 3 months. He was admitted to another hospital for aspiration pneumonia and recovered but was transferred to our hospital due to prolonged disturbance of consciousness. The patient was able to follow simple commands but had a tendency to somnolence. In addition to meningeal stimulation signs, the patient had left-dominant upper and lower limb ataxia and right-dominant limb spasticity. Brain FLAIR/T2-weighted imaging showed high-intensity lesions from the brainstem to the middle cerebellar peduncle bilaterally, medulla oblongata and upper cervical spinal cord, and T1-weighted imaging revealed contrast-enhanced lesions in the left middle cerebellar peduncle and cervical spinal cord. Although spinal fluid examination revealed elevated proteins, other laboratory tests indicated no evidence of infection, vasculitis, collagen diseases or tumors, and anti-ganglioside, anti-AQP4 and anti-MOG antibodies were negative. After admission, the patient again developed aspiration pneumonia, which progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome, and he died on the 15th day of hospitalization. Autopsy findings indicated acute and subacute demyelination mainly in the brainstem and cerebellum, and perivascular lymphocyte and macrophage infiltration in the areas of demyelination. A postmortem diagnosis of ADEM was made based on the generally monophasic course of the disease and the absence of regenerating myelinated sheaths. There are very few reports of elderly patients with brainstem ADEM. ADEM should be considered as a differential diagnosis in patients with brainstem encephalitis.',\n",

       " 'Objective Brainstem hematoma (BSH) is a high-risk condition that can lead to deadly and disabling consequences if not properly managed. However, recent advances in endoscopic techniques, employed for removing supratentorial intracerebral hemorrhage have shown significant improvements in operative morbidity and mortality rates compared to other approaches. In this study, we demonstrate the utility and feasibility of the endoscopic trans-cerebellar medullary fissure approach for the management of brain stem hemorrhage in carefully selected patients. Patients and methods A 55-year-old man presented to the emergency department in a comatose state with respiratory distress. A CT scan revealed the presence of a brainstem hemorrhage. Given the location of the hemorrhage and the need to quickly manage the associated developmental obstructive hydrocephalus and respiratory distress, an endoscopic trans-cerebellar medullary fissure approach was chosen as the most appropriate method of treatment. Results Total resection was achieved, and the patient gradually improved postoperatively with no new neurological deficits. He is currently under routine follow-up and is conscious but has partial hemiplegia. Conclusion This approach provided direct visualization of the lesion and was minimally invasive. The endoscopic trans-cerebellar medullary fissure approach may be considered an alternative to open approaches for brainstem hemorrhage in carefully selected patients.',\n",
       " 'ABSTRACT Ischaemic optic neuropathy is the most common, feared, and recognised ocular manifestation of giant cell arteritis (GCA), while extraocular muscle palsy rarely occurs in the disease. Overlooking the diagnosis of GCA in aged patients with acquired diplopia and strabismus is not only sight– but also life-threatening. Here, we present, for the first time, a case of unilateral abducens nerve palsy and contralateral anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy as the presenting signs of GCA in a 98-year-old woman. Prompt diagnosis and treatment prevented further visual loss and systemic complications and allowed for rapid resolution of the abducens nerve palsy. We also aim to discuss the possible pathophysiological mechanisms of diplopia in GCA and to emphasise that acquired cranial nerve palsy must raise suspicion of this severe disease in elderly patients, particularly in association with ischaemic optic neuropathy.',\n",
       " \"A 2-year-old girl started to wobble without any specific triggers, so the patient was admitted to our hospital's pediatric department. The entire cerebellum showed severe atrophy on MRI and much lower uptake than that in the cerebral cortex on perfusion SPECT. The diagnosis of opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome (OMS) was suspected. MRI visualized a small mass behind the inferior vena cava. Although its uptake on I-123 MIBG scintigraphy was inconclusive, the mass was surgically removed, and the diagnosis of neuroblastoma was pathologically confirmed. OMS is one of the paraneoplastic neurological syndromes with cerebellar ataxia, myoclonus of the trunk and extremities, and opsoclonus as its main symptoms. Approximately 50% of children cases with OMS are associated with neuroblastoma. The prognosis for neuroblastoma itself with OMS is relatively good, but the neurological prognosis is very poor. If there is decreased blood flow in the cerebellum of an infant, it may be necessary to search for neuroblastoma.\",\n",

Case presentation A 77-year-old male was admitted to hospital with high fever, weakness of both lower limbs, and an unstable gait. A CSF test revealed a strikingly increased protein level (1,002Â mg/L, normative values: 150-450Â mg/L) and MRI revealed hyper-signal lesions in the right temporal lobe, right hippocampus, right insula, and right cingulate gyrus. The CSF was positive for HSV PCR (HSV-1,17870). In addition, the serum samples were positive for CASPR2 antibodies (antibody titer: 1/10) and anti-GM3 immunoglobulin G (IgG) (+). The patient was diagnosed with HSV-1-induced peripheral nerve symptoms that were associated with encephalitis and the presence of anti-GM3 IgG and anti-CASPR2 antibodies. The patient had received included intravenous immunoglobulin, intravenous acyclovir, and corticosteroids therapy.

Methods We report a case of a 38Â years-old woman with a diagnosis of NMOSD and positive aquaporin-4 IgG antibody status who developed PTS five weeks after an episode of longitudinal extensive transverse myelitis (LETM). Results Repetitive, brief, and painful episodes of muscle contraction were observed on the patient's left hand, spreading to the left arm, and then extending to the four limbs. While pregabalin and topiramate had no influence on these episodes, the patient responded to carbamazepine (CBZ), without symptom recurrence after one year. Conclusions PTS in association with LETM can be considered typical for NMOSD.

       " \"Peripheral nerve injuries (PNIs) that consist of simple nerve severance often result in severe motor impairment and permanent loss of function. Such patients face significant costs and pose major burdens to healthcare systems. Currently, the most promising surgical technique to achieve the best clinical outcome after such PNIs is immediate primary coaptation of severed nerve ends by microsutures (neurorrhaphy). However, recovery is often poor and delayed for many months due to Wallerian degeneration (WD) and slow (1–2 mm/day) axonal outgrowths from severed proximal axons that may not properly reinnervate denervated afferent/efferent targets that have atrophied. In contrast, recent pre-clinical studies using polyethylene glycol (PEG) to facilitate primary nerve repair have greatly improved the rate and extent of sensory and motor recovery and prevented much WD and muscle atrophy. That is, PEG-fused axons rapidly establish proximal–distal axoplasmic/axolemmal continuity, which do not undergo WD and maintain the structure and function of neuromuscular junction (NMJ). PEG-fused axons rapidly reinnervate denervated NMJs, thereby preventing muscle atrophy associated with monthslong denervation due to slowly regenerating axonal outgrowths. We now describe PEG-mediated fusion repair of a digital nerve in each of two patients presenting with a digital laceration resulting in total loss of sensation. The first patient's tactile perception improved markedly at 3 days postoperatively (PO). Two-point discrimination improved from greater than 10 mm at initial presentation to 4 mm at 11-week PO, and the Semmes–Weinstein monofilament score improved from greater than 6.65 to 2.83 mm, a near-normal level. The second patient had severe PO edema and scar development requiring a hand compression glove and scar massage, which began improving at 11-week PO. The sensory function then improved for 4 months PO, with both two-point discrimination and Semmes–Weinstein scores approaching near-normal levels at the final follow-up. These case study data are consistent with data from animal models. All these data suggest that PEG-fusion technologies could produce a paradigm shift from the current clinical practice of waiting days to months to repair ablation PNIs with autografts, anucleated nerve allografts, or conduits in which the patient outcome is solely dependent upon axon regeneration over months or years.\",\n",

He underwent gadolinium-enhanced brain MRI and angiogram, which revealed pial enhancement in the right occipital, parietal, and posterior temporal regions with subcortical atrophy. CSF findings were unremarkable. Continuous video EEG showed electroclinical correlation for his episodes of confusion and speech arrest with recurrent brief runs of rhythmic delta from the right temporal region with evolution and spread to the entire right hemisphere. The patient tried multiple antiseizure medications including valproic acid, topiramate, phenytoin, carbamazepine, levetiracetam, brivaracetam, and lamotrigine without success. He was eventually put on a combination of lacosamide, zonisamide, clonazepam, and primidone, which helped to a certain extent, but the patient continued to have daily episodes and 10–12 electroclinical seizures noted on a follow-up 24-hour ambulatory EEG. Follow-up brain MRI with contrast confirmed the diagnosis. Phase II intracranial monitoring for surgical management was offered to the patient, which he deferred because of risks. Vagal nerve stimulator (VNS) was also offered as a palliative therapy to which the patient agreed. Gradual titration in VNS settings over 1 year helped to achieve seizure freedom.

       " 'Abstract Introduction Emotional apathy has recently been identified as a common symptom of long COVID. While recent meta-analyses have demonstrated generalized EEG slowing with the emergence of delta rhythms in patients hospitalized for severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, no EEG study or dopamine transporter scintigraphy (DaTSCAN) has been performed in patients with long COVID presenting with apathy. The objective of this case report was to explore the pathophysiology of neuropsychological symptoms in long COVID. Case Presentation A 47-year-old patient who developed a long COVID with prominent apathy following an initially clinically mild SARS-CoV-2 infection underwent neuropsychological assessment, cerebral MRI, DaTSCAN, and resting-state high-density EEG 7 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The EEG data were compared to those of 21 healthy participants. The patient presented with apathy, cognitive difficulties with dysexecutive syndrome, moderate attentional and verbal episodic memory disturbances, and resolution of premorbid mild gaming disorder, mild mood disturbances, and sleep disturbances. His MRI and DaTSCAN were unremarkable. EEG revealed a complex pattern of oscillatory abnormalities compared to the control group, with a strong increase in whole-scalp delta and beta band activity, as well as a decrease in alpha band activity. Overall, these effects were more prominent in the frontal-central-temporal region. Conclusion These results suggest widespread changes in EEG oscillatory patterns in a patient with long COVID characterized by neuropsychological complications with prominent apathy. Despite the inherent limitations of a case report, these results suggest dysfunction in the cortical networks involved in motivation and emotion.',\n",
       " 'Background Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome is a systemic disorder in which multi-organ dysfunction may occur from mitochondrial metabolism failure. Maternally inherited mutations in the MT-TL1 gene are the most frequent causes for this disorder. Clinical manifestations may include stroke-like episodes, epilepsy, dementia, headache and myopathy. Among these, acute visual failure, usually in association with cortical blindness, can occur because of stroke-like episodes affecting the occipital cortex or the visual pathways. Vision loss due to optic neuropathy is otherwise considered a typical manifestation of other mitochondrial diseases such as Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON). Case presentation Here we describe a 55-year-old woman, sister of a previously described patient with MELAS harbouring the m.3243Aâ\\x80\\x89>â\\x80\\x89G (p.0, MT-TL1) mutation, with otherwise unremarkable medical history, that presented with subacute, painful visual impairment of one eye, accompanied by proximal muscular pain and headache. Over the next weeks, she developed severe and progressive vision loss limited to one eye. Ocular examination confirmed unilateral swelling of the optic nerve head; fluorescein angiography showed segmental perfusion delay in the optic disc and papillary leakage. Neuroimaging, blood and CSF examination and temporal artery biopsy ruled out neuroinflammatory disorders and giant cell arteritis (GCA). Mitochondrial sequencing analysis confirmed the m.3243Aâ\\x80\\x89>â\\x80\\x89G transition, and excluded the three most common LHON mutations, as well as the m.3376Gâ\\x80\\x89>â\\x80\\x89A LHON/MELAS overlap syndrome mutation. Based on the constellation of clinical symptoms and signs presented in our patient, including the muscular involvement, and the results of the investigations, the diagnosis of optic neuropathy as a stroke-like event affecting the optic disc was performed. L-arginine and ubidecarenone therapies were started with the aim to improve stroke-like episode symptoms and prevention. The visual defect remained stable with no further progression or outbreak of new symptoms. Conclusions Atypical clinical presentations must be always considered in mitochondrial disorders, even in well-described phenotypes and when mutational load in peripheral tissue is low. Mitotic segregation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) does not allow to know the exact degree of heteroplasmy existent within different tissue, such as retina and optic nerve. Important therapeutic implications arise from a correct diagnosis of atypical presentation of mitochondrial disorders.

       " 'Abstract Objective The trans-cell technique in stent-assisted coil embolization is a common treatment method for intracranial aneurysm. However, despite the frequency of its use, reports discussing its complications and their management are few. We describe a case of stent and microguidewire entanglement, which could not be removed, during treatment using the trans-cell technique. We discuss the mechanism of the entanglement and its management. Case Presentation A woman in her 40s was found to have an unruptured cerebral aneurysm with a maximum diameter of 5.9 mm located in the paraclinodal anterior process of the left internal carotid artery during a close examination of a headache. The aneurysm had an irregular shape and wide neck. Stent-assisted coil embolization was planned. Initially, the coil was embolized using a jailing technique, but the microcatheter was pushed out of the aneurysm during embolization. Thus, we attempted to switch to a trans-cell technique. However, during the process, the stent and microguidewire became entangled and could not be removed. Finally, when the stent slipped off, the entanglement was resolved and the microguidewire was retrieved. Fortunately, the patient was discharged home without postoperative complications. Conclusion Once a stent and a microguidewire become entangled, safely releasing them is difficult. Thus, it is important to avoid this scenario from occurring.',\n",

Although left hemiplegic due to cerebral hemorrhage and impaired consciousness due to cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) appeared postoperatively, anticoagulant therapy quickly improved CVST and impaired consciousness. However, various unexplained symptoms such as insomnia, hallucination, impulsivity, impaired consciousness, and a new type of drug-resistant cluster seizures gradually developed over a 2-month period. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed the gradual extension of a hyperintense area from the right frontal lobe on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images. Intravenous methylprednisolone pulse was initiated from postoperative day (POD) 74, followed by intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) therapy, although white blood cell counts were normal in all three cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examinations. After IVIg therapy, the above unexplained symptoms promptly improved. On POD 103, antibodies against NMDAR were revealed in both the serum and CSF collected before these immunotherapies.

       " \"Myxoma is the most common type of benign cardiac tumor in adults, and it has a strong tendency to embolize or metastasize to distant organs. Patients with multiple brain metastases have rarely been seen in clinics; hence, standard treatment protocols for multimyxoma metastasis in the brain have not been established. We present the case of a 47-year-old female who had convulsions in the right hand and repeated seizures. Computed tomography revealed multiple tumor sites in her brain. Craniotomy was conducted to remove the tumor sites. However, recurrent brain tumors and unexpected cerebral infarctions occurred frequently shortly after the treatment because the cardiac myxoma had not been treated due to the patient's personal concerns. The myxoma was resected by gamma knife radiosurgery, and temozolomide was given prior to cardiac surgery. There has been no evidence of tumor recurrence from the 2 years following the surgery until the present. This case highlights the importance of prioritizing cardiac lesions over cerebral lesions; if a cerebral metastasis has been found, it is likely that the cardiac myxoma is already unstable, with high rates of spread and metastasis. Therefore, it is unwise to treat metastasis sites before the cardiac myxoma. Additionally, the case suggests that gamma knife radiosurgery combined with temozolomide is effective as treatment for multiple myxoma metastasis in the brain. Compared with conventional cerebral surgery, gamma knife radiosurgery is safer, causes less bleeding, and requires a shorter time for recovery.\",\n",

       " 'Introduction Bassen-Kornzweig syndrome or abetalipoproteinemia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a malabsorption of dietary fat and fat-soluble vitamins. This deficiency can lead to a variety of symptoms, including hematological (acanthocytosis, bleeding tendency), neurological (tremor, spinocerebellar ataxia), neuromuscular (myopathy), ophthalmological symptoms (retinitis pigmentosa). The thalamic ventral intermediate nucleus (VIM) is a well-established target for deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the treatment of refractory tremor. Research question We evaluated the clinical long-term follow-up (22 years) after VIM-DBS for refractory tremor in abetalipoproteinemia. We also evaluated the adjustments of stimulation settings and medication balance after DBS procedure. Material and methods We report a 53-year-old male who suffers from abetalipoproteinemia since the age of 17. He underwent bilateral VIM-DBS to treat his disabling refractory intentional tremor at the age of 31. He still has a very good response to his tremor with limited stimulation adaptations over 22 years. For more than two decades follow-up, the treatment significantly improved his ADL functions and therefore also the QoL. Discussion and conclusion The VIM target for DBS in the treatment of refractory tremor has been extensively reported in the literature. Thalamic VIM-DBS is a safe and effective treatment for a severe, refractory tremor as a neurological symptom caused by abetalipoproteinemia. It also highlights the importance of a multidisciplinary follow-up, to adjust and optimize the stimulation/medication balance after VIM-DBS surgery.

       " 'Background Cerebral palsy (CP), a complex syndrome with multiple etiologies, is characterized by a range of movement disorders within the hypokinetic and hyperkinetic spectrum (dystonia or choreoathetosis). CP is often accompanied by neurological and psychiatric signs, such as spasticity, ataxia, and cognitive disorders. Although current treatment options for CP include pharmacological interventions, rehabilitation programs, and spasticity relief surgery, their effectiveness remains limited. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has demonstrated significant effectiveness in managing dyskinesia; however, its potential therapeutic effect on CP remains determined. Methods We present a case of a 44-year-old Asian female who was born as a twin with neonatal ischemic–hypoxic encephalopathy due to prolonged labor and delivery. She was diagnosed with CP at the age of 1â\\x80\\x89year. The patient exhibited delayed development compared to her peers and presented with various symptoms, including slurred speech, broad-based gait, horseshoe inversion of the right lower extremity, involuntary shaking of the upper extremities bilaterally, and hypotonia and showed no improvement with levodopa therapy. Two years ago, she developed progressive head tremors, which worsened during periods of tension and improved during sleep. As medical treatments proved ineffective and there were no contraindications to surgery, we performed bilateral globus pallidus interna DBS (GPi-DBS) to alleviate her motor dysfunction. Results Following a 6-month follow-up, the patient demonstrated significant improvements in motor symptoms, including head and limb tremors and dystonia. In addition, significant improvement was observed in her overall psychological well-being, as evidenced by reduced anxiety and depression levels. Conclusion DBS is an effective treatment for dyskinesia symptoms associated with CP in adults. Moreover, its effectiveness may continue to increase over time.',\n",
       " 'Background In typical patients with multiple system atrophy with predominant parkinsonism (MSA-P) levodopa is ineffective. However, there are some of these patients who respond well to levodopa treatment. Levodopa efficacy in MSA-P patients is thought to be related to the degree of putaminal damage, but the pathological causation between the putaminal involvement and levodopa efficacy has not been established in detail. Objective This study aimed to evaluate the neuropathological features of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system in a \"levodopa-responsive\" MSA-P patient in comparison with \"levodopa-unresponsive\" conventional MSA-P patients. Materials and methods Clinicopathological findings were assessed in a 53-year-old Japanese man with MSA who presented with asymmetric parkinsonism, levodopa response, and later wearing-off phenomenon. During autopsy, the nigrostriatal pathology of presynaptic and postsynaptic dopaminergic receptor density and Î±-synuclein status were investigated. The other two patients with MSA-P were examined using the same pathological protocol. Results Four years after the onset, the patient died of sudden cardiopulmonary arrest. On autopsy, numerous Î±-synuclein-positive glial cytoplasmic inclusions in the basal ganglia, pons, and cerebellum were identified. The number of neurons in the putamen and immunoreactivity for dopamine receptors were well-preserved. In contrast, significant neuronal loss and decreased dopamine receptor immunoreactivity in the putamen were observed in the \"levodopa-unresponsive\" MSA-P control patients. These putaminal pathology results were consistent with the findings of premortem magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). All three patients similarly exhibited severe neuronal loss in the substantia nigra and decreased immunoreactivity for dopamine transporter. Conclusion Levodopa responsiveness in patients with MSA-P may be corroborated by the normal putamen on MRI and the preserved postsynaptic nigrostriatal dopaminergic system on pathological examination. The results presented in this study may provide a rationale for continuation of levodopa treatment in patients diagnosed with MSA-P.',\n",
       " 'Background Holmes tremor (HT) is a refractory tremor associated with cortico-basal ganglia loops and cerebellothalamic tract abnormalities. Various drug treatments have been attempted; however, no treatment method has yet been established. Historically, thalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been performed in medically refractory cases. Recently, the posterior subthalamic area (PSA) has been used for HT. Here, we report cases of HT and review the effectiveness and safety of PSA-DBS for HT. Cases We conducted a retrospective chart review of two patients with HT who underwent PSA-DBS. Improvement in tremors was observed 1 year after surgery without apparent complications. Literature review We identified 12 patients who underwent PSA-DBS for HT, including our cases. In six patients, PSA was targeted alone; for the rest, the ventralis intermediate nucleus (Vim) of the thalamus and PSA were simultaneously targeted. The Fahn–Tolosa–Marin Tremor Rating Scale improvement rates were 56.8% (range, 33.9–82.1%; n n Conclusion Reasonable improvements in HT were observed after PSA-DBS. PSA might be an appropriate target for improving the symptoms of HT. Long-term observations, accumulation of cases, and randomized studies are required in future.',\n",
       " 'Background: Various neurologic complications of hyperthyroidism are reported, and most of these complications are reversible with the amelioration of thyrotoxicosis. We report a previously undescribed concurrence of hyperthyroid-associated exercise-induced myalgia and stiffness, pyramidal tract dysfunction, and myoclonic movements that make an initial clinical diagnosis difficult. Case presentation: A 17-year-old male was hospitalized in the department of neurology, presenting with a 4-year history of severe exercise-induced myalgia and stiffness, weakness of lower limbs, and myoclonic movements. Laboratory investigations unexpectedly revealed hyperthyroidism. MRI of the brain and spine, electrophysiology, and whole exome sequencing were also performed. Antithyroid therapy led to marked improvement of neurologic symptoms, accompanied by a significant improvement of the time-dependent decline in compound muscle action potentials (CMAP) amplitudes after exercise and normalization of the prolonged QTc interval. Genetic analysis identified a rare variant in SCN5A. Conclusion: This case report provides important insights into the relationship between hyperthyroidism and neurologic/cardiac complications, particularly in those with a genetic predisposition. SCN5A mutation possibly plays a role in the complex neurological syndrome associated with hyperthyroidism. Further studies are warranted to better understand the underlying mechanisms and potential therapeutic options for these complex conditions.',\n",

       " 'Deep brain stimulation (DBS) to the ventral intermediate nucleus (VIM) of the thalamus has become a common procedure for some refractory, medication-resistant movement disorders like essential tremors. The most common adverse effects from this surgery include dysarthria and gait disturbances. This case report details a left gaze and ipsilateral facial nerve palsy following overshot cannula insertion into the pons during a VIM DBS procedure. Initial patient presentation after surgery revealed significant impairment of horizontal gaze to the left. This improved during follow-up visits and after the recession of the bilateral medial recti. When considering complications of the VIM DBS procedure, surgeons should be aware of the risks of cannula overshot given the anatomic proximity between the thalamus and brainstem. Furthermore, patients should be aware of this risk when making their surgical decision. All patients who undergo VIM DBS should be assessed for cranial nerve deficits after placement.',\n",
       " 'The withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies is frequently considered for pediatric patients with severe acute brain injuries who are admitted to the intensive care unit. However, it is worth noting that some children with a resultant poor neurological status may ultimately survive and achieve a positive neurological outcome. Evidence suggests that adults with hidden consciousness may have a more favorable prognosis compared to those without it. Currently, no treatable network disorders have been identified in cases of severe acute brain injury, aside from seizures detectable through an electroencephalogram (EEG) and neurostimulation via amantadine. In this report, we present three cases in which multimodal brain network evaluation played a helpful role in patient care. This evaluation encompassed various assessments such as continuous video EEG, visual-evoked potentials, somatosensory-evoked potentials, auditory brainstem-evoked responses, resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI), and passive-based and command-based task-based fMRI. It is worth noting that the latter three evaluations are unique as they have not yet been established as part of the standard care protocol for assessing acute brain injuries in children with suppressed consciousness. The first patient underwent serial fMRIs after experiencing a coma induced by trauma. Subsequently, the patient displayed improvement following the administration of antiseizure medication to address abnormal signals. In the second case, a multimodal brain network evaluation uncovered covert consciousness, a previously undetected condition in a pediatric patient with acute brain injury. In both patients, this discovery potentially influenced decisions concerning the withdrawal of life support. Finally, the third patient serves as a comparative control case, demonstrating the absence of detectable networks. Notably, this patient underwent the first fMRI prior to experiencing brain death as a pediatric patient. Consequently, this case series illustrates the clinical feasibility of employing multimodal brain network evaluation in pediatric patients. This approach holds potential for clinical interventions and may significantly enhance prognostic capabilities beyond what can be achieved through standard testing methods alone.',\n",

Additionally, the negative prognosis is associated with inherited thrombophilia, which includes the presence of homozygous Factor V G1691A Leiden mutation, MTHFR gene polymorphisms C677T and A1298C, and PAI-1 675 homozygous genotype 5G/5G. Case presentation This case report presents a 48-year-old man with chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia, bilateral ptosis, cerebellar ataxia, cardiovascular signs (syncope, dilated cardiomyopathy, and cardiac arrest) with electrocardiographic abnormalities (first-degree atrioventricular block and major right bundle branch block), endocrine dysfunction (short stature, growth hormone insufficiency, primary gonadal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, and secondary hyperparathyroidism), molecular genetic tests (MT-TL2 gene), and abnormal MRI brain images, thus leading to the diagnosis of KSS. The patient came back 4 weeks after the diagnosis to the emergency department with massive bilateral pulmonary embolism with syncope at onset, acute cardiorespiratory failure, deep left femoral-popliteal vein thrombophlebitis, and altered neurological status. In the intensive care unit, he received mechanical ventilation through intubation. Significant improvement was seen after 2 weeks. The patient tested positive for inherited thrombophilia and was discharged in stable conditions on a new treatment with Rivaroxaban 20 mg/day. At 6 months of follow-up, ECG-Holter monitoring and MRI brain images remained unchanged. However, after 3 months, the patient died suddenly while sleeping at home. Conclusion The genetic tests performed on KSS patients should also include those for inherited thrombophilia. By detecting these mutations, we can prevent major complications such as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, coronary accidents, or sudden death.',\n",

       " \"Introduction Subthalamic (STN) local field potentials (LFPs) in the beta band are considered potential biomarkers for closed-loop deep brain stimulation (DBS) in Parkinson's disease (PD). The beta band is further dissected into low-and high-frequency components with somewhat different functions, although their concomitance and association in the single patient is far to be defined. We present a 56-year-old male PD patient undergoing DBS showing a double-beta peak activity on both sides. The aim of the study was to investigate how low-and high-beta peaks were influenced by plasma levodopa (L-dopa) levels, stimulation, and motor performances. Methods A systematic evaluation of raw LFPs, plasma L-dopa levels, and motor tasks was performed in the following four conditions: OFF medications/ON stimulation, OFF medications/OFF stimulation, ON medications/OFF stimulation, and ON medications/ON stimulation. Results The analysis of the LFP spectra suggests the following results: (1) the high-beta peak was suppressed by stimulation, while the low-beta peak showed a partial and not consistent response to stimulation; (2) the high-beta peak is also influenced by plasma L-dopa concentration, showing a progressive amplitude increment concordant with plasma L-dopa levels, while the low-beta peak shows a different behavir; and (3) motor performances seem to impact beta peaks behavior. Conclusion This single exploratory case study illustrates a complex behavior of low-and high-beta peaks in a PD patient, in response to stimulation, L-dopa plasma levels, and motor performances.

Here, we report a rare case of Actinomyces meyeri Case presentation We present the case of a 38-years-old primipara admitted to the emergency department at our hospital with a 4-day history of fever and vomiting. The symptoms worsened rapidly during the 8Â h prior to admission, and the patient experienced a sudden loss of consciousness 4Â h before arrival to the unit. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed abnormal signals in the right parietal–temporal lobe, suggesting the possibility of abscess rupture into the ventricle and sulcus. Right lateral ventricle compression and midline structure deviation to the left were noted. A right temporal–occipital mass with midline shift was detected. Emergency procedures were promptly performed, including craniotomy, removal of the right temporal–occipital mass, decompressive craniectomy, implantation of an intracranial pressure monitoring device, and external ventricular drainage. Cerebrospinal fluid culture indicated infection with Actinomyces meyeri. Conclusions Although the patient did not present with any apparent predisposing causes for brain abscess, a scout view of CT revealed dental caries. In addition, the occurrence of the brain abscess may have been influenced by the hormonal changes during pregnancy, including increased secretion of estrogen and progesterone, as well as decreased immune function. Early diagnosis and intervention are crucial in such cases. Therefore, it is recommended to seek early medical attention if symptoms such as fever, vomiting, and changes in mental state occur during pregnancy, as the prognosis for both the mother and infant is poor once the abscess ruptures.

       " 'Background Kernicterus in the acute phase is difficult to diagnose. It depends on a high signal on T1 at the globus pallidum and subthalamic nucleus level. Unfortunately, these areas also show a relatively high signal on T1 in neonates as an expression of early myelination. Therefore, a less myelin-dependent sequence, like SWI, may be more sensitive to detecting damage in the globus pallidum area. Case presentation A term baby developed jaundice on day three following an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery. Total bilirubin peaked at 542â\\x80\\x89Î¼mol/L on day four. Phototherapy was started, and an exchange transfusion was performed. ABR showed absent responses on day 10. MRI on day eight demonstrated abnormal high signal globus pallidus on T1w, isointense on T2w, without diffusion restriction, and high signal on SWI at globus pallidal and subthalamus level and phase image at globus pallidal level. These findings were consistent with the challenging diagnosis of kernicterus. On follow-up, the infant presented with sensorineural hearing loss and had a work-up for cochlear implant surgery. At 3 months of age, the follow-up MR shows normalization of the T1 and SWI signals and a high signal on T2. Conclusions SWI seems more sensitive to injury than the T1w and lacks the disadvantage of the T1w sequence, where early myelin confers a high signal.',\n",

STN-DBS significantly improved his PD symptoms; however, he developed persistent and daily hiccups. As of writing, 24 months after surgery, the patient experiences hiccups several times per day with no associated gastrointestinal complaints and with significant improvement in his PD symptoms. This report describes the case details and summarizes the existing literature describing hiccups in patients undergoing surgical treatment for PD.\",\n",
       " 'A 78-year-old man developed paresthesias in the extremities. He was referred to our hospital because of positive anti-human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) antibodies in the serum and the presence of abnormal lymphocytes. He was diagnosed as chronic-type adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. Neurological examination revealed sensory impairment in the distal parts of the extremities with loss of deep tendon reflexes. Nerve conduction study showed motor and sensory demyelinating polyneuropathy, indicating a diagnosis of HTLV-1-associated demyelinating neuropathy. Corticosteroid therapy followed by intravenous immunoglobulin therapy improved his symptoms. Since demyelinating neuropathy associated with HTLV-1 infection is not well recognized, we here report its characteristics and clinical course through our case report and literature review.

Even though it is generally accepted that the nidus of a ruptured bAVM may be underestimated in angiography during the acute phase due to hematoma compression, documentation of the underestimated parts has not been described in the literature. The authors report 2 cases of ruptured bAVMs in which the obscured segments were cast with liquid embolic material, which suggests a potential presence of obscured segments in bAVMs.',\n",
       " \"Background: Subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) is widely used for the treatment of primary motor symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Further, recent evidence suggests that STN-DBS may relieve a few ophthalmic symptoms in PD, such as eye-blink rate and the flexibility of eye saccades. However, its exact effect on visual function remains unknown. Herein, we report the case of a patient with PD who underwent STN-DBS and experienced visual symptoms following levodopa reduction. Case presentation: A 63-year-old male patient with PD developed severe visual impairment after six months of high-frequency STN-DBS. His symptoms resolved after adjusting the levodopa dose prescribed to the patient. Conclusions: This case report suggests that DBS is beneficial in patients with PD in terms of eye-blink rate. However, the rapid reduction of medication after STN-DBS may lead to retinal atrophy and the shrinkage of vessel density in the ocular fundus. Thus, neurosurgeons should pay close attention to patients with visual symptoms when adjusting levodopa dosages.\",\n",
       " \"Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) primarily affects the respiratory system. During the global coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, COVID-19-associated neurological diseases have been increasingly reported, including peripheral nervous system diseases, such as Guillain–BarrÃ© syndrome (GBS). Acute motor-sensory axonal polyneuropathy (AMSAN), is a GBS variant associated with COVID-19. To date, there are no reports of GBS cases with thalamic injury and dynamic evolution with fluctuating GBS symptoms. In this report, we describe the first case of COVID-19-associated AMSAN accompanied by a thalamic lesion and discuss the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings. Case presentation A 76-year-old woman, with known co-morbid type 2 diabetes mellitus, presented to the emergency room with complaints of weakness and paraesthesia in both her legs and arms for 4â\\x80\\x89days, and fever and dry cough for the past 5â\\x80\\x89days. A nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 returned positive. The patient had not received specific treatment for COVID-19 infection. Neurological examination disclosed symmetric weakness (Medical Research Council grade upper limbs 4/5, lowers limbs 2/5) and areflexia in both the legs and feet. No cranial nerves were involved. Following a neuro-electro-physiology study to evaluate neurological symptoms, AMSAN was suggested. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed elevated protein levels that confirmed the diagnosis of GBS. The patient was subsequently treated with intravenous immune globulin (IVIG), which improved her neurological symptoms (upper limbs 4/5, lowers limbs 4/5). However, urinary retention, dysarthria, dysphagia, bilateral facial paralysis, facial diplegia, bucking, and motor alalia gradually appeared, followed by aggravated paralysis (upper limbs 3/5, lowers limbs 1/5). After being hospitalized for 16â\\x80\\x89days, the patient underwent continuous plasma exchange (PE) treatment for a duration of 3â\\x80\\x89days. Following treatment, the patient's neurological symptoms and paralysis gradually improved (upper limbs 4/5, lowers limbs 4/5) over 2â\\x80\\x89weeks. Meanwhile, we observed that the patient's cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings dynamically evolved along with the fluctuation of her GBS symptoms, mainly in terms of the changes in T2 hyperintensity in the right thalamus accompanied by microhaemorrhages. The inflammation index was normal. We considered a wide range of possible causes including hypoxia, drugs, toxins, and metabolic derangements but these were excluded. Conclusion The AMSAN variant of GBS secondary to COVID-19 infection is severe and can cause extensive damage to the peripheral nerves system. The deterioration of symptoms in the patient after early immunotherapy may indicate treatment-related fluctuation (TRF) and could be attributed to immune rebound. Moreover, an excessive immune response post-COVID-19 infection may trigger concurrent damage to the central nervous system, indicating secondary harm to brain small blood vessels and nerve units. For suspected cases of GBS complicated by COVID-19, it is essential to conduct early brain MRI examinations in addition to routine peripheral nervous system evaluations to promptly detect any intracranial lesions. This facilitates appropriate immunotherapy and improves patient prognosis.\",\n",
       " 'Background Nivolumab is an immune checkpoint inhibitor that targets the programmed cell death-1 protein and is effective in treating advanced cancer. However, it is also associated with various immune-related neurological complications, including myasthenia gravis, Guillain–BarrÃ© syndrome, and demyelinating polyneuropathy. These complications can easily mimic other neurological diseases and have greatly varying therapeutic approaches depending on the underlying pathophysiology. Case presentation Here, we report a case of nivolumab-induced demyelinating peripheral polyneuropathy involving the brachial plexus in a patient with Hodgkin lymphoma. Approximately 7 months after nivolumab treatment, the patient experienced muscle weakness with a tightness and tingling sensation in the right forearm. Electrodiagnostic studies showed features of demyelinating peripheral neuropathy with right brachial plexopathy. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed thickening with a diffuse enhancement of both brachial plexuses. The patient was eventually diagnosed with nivolumab-induced demyelinating polyneuropathy involving the brachial plexus. Oral steroid therapy improved motor weakness and sensory abnormalities without aggravation. Conclusion Our study indicates the possibility of nivolumab-induced neuropathies in cases involving muscle weakness with sensory abnormalities of the upper extremity following nivolumab administration in patients with advanced cancer. Comprehensive electrodiagnostic studies and magnetic resonance imaging are helpful in the differential diagnosis of other neurological diseases. Appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic approaches may prevent further neurological deterioration.',\n",
       " 'Abstract Posterior ischemic optic neuropathy (PION), a relatively rare condition, is diagnosed primarily based on the clinical presentation of sudden visual impairment, an optic nerve-related visual field defect, and an initial normal optic disc that corresponds to its pathology of acute ischemia. Among its etiologies, nonarteritic PION is one of the most common causes. Studies on cases of PION associated with herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO) are limited, and the diagnosis was made based on the appearance of visual symptoms shortly following rashes. We describe a 64-year-old Asian woman with sudden painless visual loss in the upper half visual field of the left eye 6 weeks after ipsilateral HZO. Within a week, her left vision progressed to total visual loss. Initial examination revealed a near-total visual defect and a normal appearance of the optic disc in the left eye. Laboratory and imaging studies excluded the compressive, infiltrative, or inflammatory etiologies of the left optic nerve. Considering the temporal relationship between the skin rash and visual loss, HZO was the most likely cause of the nonarteritic PION. The patient was given a short course of oral valaciclovir and aspirin. At 6 weeks after the visual loss, an examination revealed stationary visual acuity and visual field defect in the left eye with a pale optic disc, and a retinal nerve fiber loss in the left eye. Compared with previous studies, our case demonstrated a delayed presentation of nonarteritic PION following HZO and broadened the scope of herpes zoster optic neuropathy.',\n",

       " 'Background Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) astrocytopathy, a novel autoimmune disease of the nervous system, was first defined in 2016. To our knowledge, area postrema syndrome (APS) with linear enhancement along the surface of the brainstem and fourth ventricle is extremely rare in this disorder. Case presentation A Chinese woman presented with intractable nausea and vomiting after onset of flu-like symptoms. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) disclosed abnormal signal intensities in the dorsal medulla oblongata including area postrema. Besides, linear enhancement surrounding the surface of the brainstem and fourth ventricle was visualized after gadolinium injection. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed increased cell count and protein. A cell-based assay was positive for anti-GFAP IgG in CSF. She was diagnosed with autoimmune GFAP astrocytopathy and treated with high-dose glucocorticoid. The patient received a quick recovery with entire resolution of the initial abnormalities. Conclusions Isolated APS can be the initial manifestation of autoimmune GFAP astrocytopathy. Linear enhancement surrounding the surface of the brainstem and fourth ventricle is another neuroradiological hallmark.',\n",
       " 'Neuroblastoma is one of the most common tumors in children. Cases where an isolated soft-tissue metastasis mass is the initial symptom are rare, with only four such cases reported to date. We describe the imaging findings of ten cases of neuroblastoma patients in our hospital with superficial soft tissue mass (SSTM) as the primary symptom. The main ultrasound finding of SSTM was hypoechoic masses or scattered speck-like hyperechoic masses. However, when this type of SSTM is caused by soft tissue metastasis, the location is often atypical, and ultrasound findings are difficult to distinguish from other benign diseases. Therefore, this research should remind clinicians to recognize atypical presentations of this common childhood malignant tumor. Radiologists should also consider the possibility of neuroblastoma when finding this type of SSTM with atypical ultrasound features.',\n",
       " \"Background Satralizumab, a monoclonal antibody that recognizes interleukin-6 receptors, is known to reduce the relapse rate in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), but its safety during pregnancy has not been established. We present the case of an NMOSD patient who safely completed pregnancy, parturition, and breastfeeding under satralizumab treatment. Importantly, satralizumab transfer to umbilical cord blood, infant serum, or breast milk was not observed. Case presentation A 37-year-old Japanese female developed anti-aquaporin 4 antibody-positive NMOSD with left optic neuritis. Despite responding to steroid and azathioprine therapy, she experienced moon face and weight gain and desired the prompt reduction of the steroid dosage. She also wanted to conceive a child with a safe and preferably early pregnancy and parturition. Because pregnancy and parturition after the onset of NMOSD elevate the risk of relapse and miscarriage, treatment with satralizumab was initiated with the patient's consent. She experienced normal parturition and continued with satralizumab, steroid, and azathioprine treatments while breastfeeding without experiencing any relapses. Concentrations of satralizumab in the umbilical cord blood, infant serum, and breast milk were below the detection sensitivity. Conclusion These findings suggest that satralizumab may be safe and effective for the perinatal management of NMOSD, especially when there are concerns about continuing pregnancy and the risk of relapse after parturition.\",\n",
       " 'Background: Common etiologies of sciatic mononeuropathy are compressive, infiltrative, traumatic, or diabetic. However, in a proportion of patients, the etiology remains elusive despite extensive serological, electrophysiological, radiological, and histological investigations. Methods: Patients with unexplained sciatic mononeuropathy were studied with regard to their clinical, radiological, pathological, and treatment aspects. Results: We could identify five cases of sciatic mononeuropathy wherein the etiology remained unknown even after a comprehensive evaluation. The compressive, metabolic, hematological, and immune causes were ruled out with necessary investigations. The clinical, electrophysiological, radiological, and histological features of these patients are discussed. Conclusion: The etiology of sciatic mononeuropathy can remain obscure in certain instances in spite of the comprehensive workup. The role of investigations and the exclusion process of various diagnostic entities are discussed.',\n",

This patient was initially diagnosed with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) and treated accordingly, but neurological symptoms did not improve significantly. After this admission, FDG-PET/CT showed focal hypermetabolism of a soft-tissue mass in the nasal cavity, and further lesion biopsy suggested ONB. Combined with positive serum anti-Hu antibody, the diagnosis of PPN associated with ONB was eventually made. Furthermore, the patient's neurological symptoms were relieved after removal of the primary tumor, confirming the accuracy of the diagnosis. Conclusion Our case not only expanded the clinical characteristics of ONB but also highlighted the importance of early and comprehensive tumor screening for the diagnosis of PPN.\",\n",

The term \"crossed aphasia\" denotes an acquired language dysfunction caused by a lesion in the ipsilateral hemisphere to the dominant hand. Objective: To describe a case of crossed aphasia in a 60-year-old left-handed patient with a non-fluent variant of primary progressive aphasia diagnosis (age of onset=52), evidenced by a left asymmetry on brain SPECT scan. Methods: Clinical and family history, the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory, Measurement of Functional Activities in Older Adults in the Community, the \"Mini-Mental State Examination\", the Trail Making Test, the Tower of London, and the Neuropsychological assessment for dementia, and neuroimaging studies were carried out. Results: Neuropsychological assessment showed severe cognitive impairment, especially regarding language. The magnetic resonance imaging showed important signs of cortico-subcortical atrophy, with predominance in the frontal and temporal lobes. The single-photon emission computed tomography scan showed moderate to severe hypoperfusion in the left cerebral hemisphere, including the hippocampus.

Here, we report a patient who developed distal arm paresis, dominantly of the right arm, over the course of 1â\\x80\\x89year. Electroneurography showed a conduction block of motor nerve conduction, nerve ultrasonography a swelling of the right median and ulnar nerve and flow cytometry an increase in natural killer (NK cells) in the blood and natural killer T (NKT) cells in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), therefore indicating a multifocal motor neuropathy-like (MMN-like) phenotype. CASPR2 autoantibodies were detected in serum and CSF. Through immunotherapy with intravenous immunoglobulins the patient showed clinical and neurographic improvement.

Clinical features that predict post-PV MF lack specificity. Case presentation We describe an elderly patient with PV who developed acute-onset reversible neuropsychiatric disturbances accompanied by generalized chorea and was finally diagnosed with post-PV MF after a bone marrow examination. We also reviewed four cases of late PV associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms since 1966 and analyzed their clinical characteristics and therapeutic effects. Conclusion Our case indicates that Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)-related PV is a treatable cause of late-onset chorea and that chorea may herald the deterioration of hematological parameters. Our case provides a clinically specific representation of post-PV MF. Patients with a long course of PV are recommended to undergo bone marrow re-examinations when they present with neuropsychiatric symptoms to achieve an early diagnosis of post-PV MF.',\n",

However, he had a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection after 2 months and suffered from drastically worsened oropharyngeal dysphagia that required a reinsertion of the nasogastric tube. A videofluoroscopic swallowing study revealed poor bolus oral transit, significantly delayed swallowing reflex, reduced pharyngeal movements, and insufficient cough response. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and neuromuscular electrical stimulation were applied, in addition to conventional swallowing training. The feeding tube was removed after 20 treatment sessions. Clinicians should be aware of the risk of dysphagia after COVID-19 infection in patients with underlying neurological diseases.

       " \"ABSTRACT A 29-year-old female with no family history presented with bilateral progressive blurred vision. Her symptoms appeared at 12-years-old and her visual acuity had since deteriorated from 0.6 to 0.2 bilaterally with decreased critical flicker frequency and bilateral central scotomas. She did not have a relative afferent pupillary defect. Fundoscopy revealed no distinct disc hyperaemia, atrophy, or peripapillary telangiectatic vessels. The retinal nerve fibre layer appeared normal on optical coherence tomography in each eye; however, loss of the interdigitation zone and the disruption of the ellipsoid zone at the fovea were observed in both eyes. Multifocal electroretinography revealed decreased amplitudes at both macula regions. Mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid analysis identified an m.14502T>C mutation, one of the primary mutations causing Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON). Despite the presence of a marked LHON mutation, however, she was clinically diagnosed as having an occult macular dystrophy. There have only been five previous case reports, all of which were sporadic, which detail the clinical characteristics of the m.14502T>C mutation. The m.14502T>C phenotype is somewhat consistent with that of the other major mutations, including young onset, bilateral progressive visual impairment, and a typical LHON fundus. Nevertheless, m.14502T>C alone has an extremely low penetrance and its phenotype may be minimal or subclinical, as seen in our case. Since little is known about the clinical course of the m.14502T>C mutation it may be possible that the LHON phenotype may appear in later stages of life. Moreover, m.14502T>C may function as a modifier gene, which alters the phenotype of other coexisting major LHON mutations, including penetrance and the severity of the disease, through synergistic effects.\",\n",
       " \"Meningioma is the most common brain tumor among all histologically reported malignant and non-malignant tumors of the central nervous system. Angiomatous meningioma is one of the subtypes of meningioma that is rarely reported. In this paper, we present a case of a 67-year-old female patient who sought consultation due to seizure, cognitive decline, and parkinsonism. Contrast-enhanced MRI showed a well-defined tumor in the left frontal lobe convexity with extensive perilesional edema. A tumor excision was done and histopathology studies revealed an angiomatous meningioma subtype. This case is reportable because angiomatous meningioma is a recognized rare entity. It is important to share this entity with other medical professionals and start to consider this condition in differential diagnosis when diagnosing a patient with an intracranial mass with an extensive peritumoral edema. Furthermore, the patient's unusual presentation of parkinsonian features and its occurrence with colorectal cancer history suggest a possible association between these conditions.\",\n",
       " 'Higher brain dysfunction commonly occurs following traumatic brain injury (TBI), and may manifest in a social behavioral impairment which can significantly impede active social participation. We report two cases, one of voyeurism and the second of alcohol abuse, which might have been caused by TBI resulting in disinhibition, a type of social behavioral impairment. We discuss the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms to raise awareness of such cases and aid the development of effective interventions. Patient 1 suffered a TBI at 18 years of age, 2 years after which he presented repeated episodes of sexually deviant behavior (voyeurism). At 28, he committed suicide, since he was unable to control his aberrant behavior. Patient 2 suffered a TBI at the age of 13. He first displayed problematic behavior 7 years later, which included drinking excessive amounts of alcohol and stealing while inebriated. Despite both patients having sound moral judgment, they had irrational and uncontrollable impulses of desire. Imaging findings could explain the possible causes of impulse control impairments. Damage to the basal ganglia and limbic system, which are involved in social behavior, presumably led to desire-dominated behavior, leading to the patients conducting unlawful acts despite intact moral judgment. It is crucial to educate society about the prevalence of these disorders, explain how these disinhibitions start, and develop effective interventions.',\n",

Methods We present the case of a woman with metoclopramide-induced TDD, whose symptoms were initially misjudged as \"functional.\" After 8 years of ineffective medical treatments, she received bilateral implantation of quadripolar electrodes into the posteroventral lateral globus pallidus internus (GPi). Results GPi DBS led to significant symptom reduction [Burke–Fahn–Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale (BFMDRS) motor score 24/44 at admission and 7/44 at discharge]. Chronic stimulation led to full recovery from TDD symptoms 9 years after surgery. The BFMDRS motor score decreased to 0.5 (98% improvement). Discussion Pallidal DBS may result in sustained improvement of TDD secondary to chronic metoclopramide intake in the long term.',\n",

       " 'Purpose Cognitive impairment secondary to traumatic brain injury (TBI) is difficult to treat and usually results in severe disability. Method A 48-year-old man presented with chronic refractory headaches and persistent disabling cognitive impairment after TBI. He was first treated with occipital nerve stimulation (ONS) implanted bilaterally to relieve headaches (8 years after the head trauma). Two years later, he was treated with a 6-week protocol combining repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) delivered to multiple cortical sites (prefrontal cortex, language areas, and areas involved in visuo-spatial functions) and computerized cognitive training (CogT) (targeting memory, language, and visuo-spatial functions) to improve cognitive performance. Results Executive and cognitive functions (attention, ability to perform calculations, and verbal fluency) improved in association with pain relief after ONS (33–42% improvement) and then improved even more after the rTMS-CogT protocol with an additional improvement of 36–40% on apathy, depression, and anxiety, leading to a significant reduction in caregiver burden. The functional improvement persisted and even increased at 6 months after the end of the rTMS-CogT procedure (10 years after the onset of TBI and 2 years after ONS implantation). Conclusion This is the first observation describing sustained improvement in post-TBI refractory headache, depression, and cognitive impairment by the association of bilaterally implanted ONS and a combined procedure of multisite rTMS and CogT to target various brain functions.',\n",

This case report describes a unique instance of recurrent sporadic MTT within the carotid sheath in a 33-year-old male without any personal or familial history of neurofibromatosis. The patient initially presented with a biopsy-confirmed MTT in the right neck, involving the carotid body and brachial plexus, and underwent partial resection, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. Six months later, the patient presented with recurrent MTT, and subsequently underwent radical tumor resection, segmental right carotid artery resection, and deep femoral vein interposition.

Herein, we describe an uncommon presentation of sciatic mononeuropathy due to ischiofemoral impingement during labor. A 29-year-old, gravida 4 para 2, female presented post-partum with acute left lower limb paresthesia and left foot drop, following spontaneous vaginal delivery of twins. Neurological examination demonstrated no activation of the left sciatic-innervated muscles and sensory loss in the same distribution. Electromyography (EMG) demonstrated an acute complete left sciatic mononeuropathy. MRI of the lumbosacral plexus and sciatic nerve showed a narrowed quadratus femoris space with mild edema of the muscle, consistent with ischiofemoral impingement syndrome. In addition, there was flattening of the sciatic nerve as it passed through the ischiofemoral space. She was treated conservatively, and at 7-month follow-up, there was marked improvement in muscle strength with ongoing sensory impairment. Repeat EMG demonstrated reinnervation in all sciatic-innervated muscles. This case highlights the risk of a sciatic mononeuropathy secondary to ischiofemoral impingement in the peripartum setting.

At the age of 30 years-old, he complained of infertility lasting for 2 years. Semen analyses showed low motility spermatozoa and a high percentage of morphological or ultrastructural abnormalities. Levels of epididymal markers were strongly atypical. Idebenone was prescribed as treatment of his Leber hereditary optic neuropathy in order to improve his visual acuity. After 5 months of this treatment, motility of spermatozoa increased, and their vitality improved. A natural conception occurred. Outcome This case is the first description of an anomaly of spermatozoas and of the epididymis epithelium in a patient with Leber hereditary optic neuropathy. It draws attention to sperm pathologies in patients with mitochondrial disorders. The role of the mtDNA mutations must be suspected since it plays an important role in the development and motility of spermatozoa. In addition, idebenone can by-pass the complex I and transfer electrons to complex III. It has been suspected to have a favorable effect on spermatogenesis. Conclusion This case confirms the possibility of sperm dysfunction in Leber hereditary optic neuropathy and the interest of idebenone as a treatment for infertility due to mtDNA mutations in human.',\n",
       " \"Post-traumatic trigeminal neuropathic pain (PTNP) combined with secondary dystonia are rare sequelae of orofacial injury and often do not respond to conservative treatment. The consensus on treatment for both symptoms is yet to be standardized. This study reports the case of a 57-year-old male patient with left orbital trauma who developed PTNP immediately after the injury and secondary hemifacial dystonia 7 months thereafter. To treat his neuropathic pain, we performed peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) using a percutaneously implanted electrode to the ipsilateral supraorbital notch along the brow arch, which instantly resolved the patient's pain and dystonia. PTNP was relieved in a satisfactory manner until 18 months after the surgery, despite a gradual recurrence of the dystonia since 6 months after the surgery. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of PNS used for the treatment of PTNP combined with dystonia. This case report highlights the potential benefits of PNS in relieving neuropathic pain and dystonia and discusses the underlying therapeutic mechanism. Moreover, this study suggests that secondary dystonia occurs due to the uncoordinated integration of afferent sensory and efferent motor information. The findings of the present study indicate that PNS should be considered for patients with PTNP following the failure of conservative treatment. Secondary hemifacial dystonia may benefit from PNS upon further research and long-term assessment.\",\n",
       " 'While it was previously believed that neuromyelitis optic spectrum disorder (NMOSD) mostly affected the optic nerves and the spinal cord, it is increasingly recognized that NMOSD can involve any area of the CNS where aquaporin-4 is highly expressed. These other areas can include the hypothalamus and the circumventricular organs that surround the third and fourth ventricles, serving as osmoregulators. The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) is one of the most common causes of hyponatremia and has been associated with NMOSD due to these lesions. In this report, we present a case of a patient with known NMOSD, who presented with dizziness, fatigue, and generalized weakness and whose workup revealed hyponatremia in the setting of SIADH and hypothalamic demyelinating lesions. This case illustrates an atypical presentation of NMOSD and the importance of looking for syndromes, such as SIADH.

A comprehensive literature review was conducted to identify similar cases. Ten additional cases of neurological pathology resulting from copper deficiency in the context of WD over-treatment were identified, all occurring during therapy with zinc salts. Myelopathy and peripheral neuropathy were the most common complications, while two additional groups reported leukoencephalopathy. Early cytopenia was often associated with copper deficiency-related neurological pathology appearing early in the context of copper deficiency. WD patients undergoing treatment, especially with zinc salts, should be closely monitored to prevent over-treatment and the consequent copper deficiency. Regular complete blood counts could provide early detection of copper deficiency, avoiding irreversible neurological damage. Swift recognition of new neurological signs not consistent with WD and timely discontinuation of the decoppering therapy are critical for improving outcomes.

We propose a syndrome caused by auto-immune reactivity triggered by molecular mimicry between VZV and the brain, culminating in a post-infectious psychiatric syndrome with childhood VZV infections. Case presentation Two individuals, a 6-year-old male and 10-year-old female developed a neuro-psychiatric syndrome 3–6 weeks following a confirmed VZV infection with intrathecal oligoclonal bands. The 6-year-old male presented with a myasthenic syndrome, behavior deterioration and regression in school, he was poorly responsive to IVIG and risperidone, however had a pronounced response to steroid treatment. The 10-year-old female presented with marked insomnia, agitation, and behavioral regression as well as mild bradykinesia. A trial of neuroleptics and sedatives resulted in a mild unsustained reduction in psychomotor agitation and IVIG was also unsuccessful, however the patient was very responsive to steroid therapy.

Causes of diplopia include eye pathologies in monocular diplopia and ischemic ocular motor nerve palsies, sudden life-threatening and chronic conditions in central nervous system in binocular diplopia. Strabismic amblyopia and nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy are quite often ophthalmic conditions, first one is caused by suppression during developmental period and the latter one by ischemia of the optic nerve in adults. Coexistence of aforementioned conditions may cause unusual clinical situation in which ability of nervous system to functional reorganization could be demonstrated. CASE PRESENTATION: In our adult patient, diplopia was incited by the loss of suppression of the strabismic amblyopic eye, which was the consequence of a sudden decrease of the visual acuity in the previously better eye in the course of nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. This led to impairment in daily activities. RESULTS: Visual training rehabilitation improved distance and near visual acuity in the amblyopic eye over three months, and prescribing two pairs of glasses with prisms enabled the patient to return to daily activities.

While numerous reports of sudden cardiac-related deaths from butane inhalation have been described, butane-associated acute encephalopathy has rarely been reported. Case presentation A 38-year-old man presented with cognitive dysfunction after butane gas inhalation. Neuropsychological test results showed impairments in verbal and visual memory, and frontal executive function. Diffusion weighted MRI revealed symmetric high-signal changes in the bilateral hippocampus and globus pallidus. FDG-PET demonstrated decreased glucose metabolism in the bilateral precuneus and occipital areas and the left temporal region. At the 8-month follow-up, he showed still significant deficits in memory and frontal functions. Diffuse cortical atrophy with white matter hyperintensities and extensive glucose hypometabolism were detected on follow-up MRI and FDG-PET, respectively. Brain autopsy demonstrated necrosis and cavitary lesions in the globus pallidus. Conclusions Only a few cases of butane encephalopathy have been reported to date. Brain lesions associated with butane encephalopathy include lesions in the bilateral thalamus, insula, putamen, and cerebellum. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on bilateral hippocampal and globus pallidal involvement in acute butane encephalopathy. The pathophysiology of central nervous system complications induced by butane intoxication is not yet fully understood. However, the direct toxic effects of butane or anoxic injury secondary to cardiac arrest or respiratory depression have been suggested as possible mechanisms of edematous changes in the brain after butane intoxication.',\n",

Since then, multiple articles have been published in attempts to improve the understanding of this rare disease. Clinically Susac Syndrome is known to present with triad of encephalopathy, sensorineural hearing loss and branch of retinal artery occlusion (BRAO), along with characteristic \"snowball\" or \"spoke\" appearing white matter lesions of the corpus callosum. It has been characterized by vast heterogeneity in terms of its presenting symptoms, severity, and clinical course. Although subset of patients present with severe forms of Susac Syndrome and can develop prominent residual neurologic deficits, it has been reported to be mostly non-life-threatening and only few fatal cases have been described in the literature. Based on the available case reports with fatal outcome, mortality has been related to the systemic complications either during acute disease flare or during chronic-progressive phase.

Descriptions of novel distinctive features are pivotal to untangling this condition's clinical and instrumental signature in order to inform diagnosis and pathophysiology. Case A 27-year-old female patient received anti-CD19 CAR T cells for a refractory primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma. At 6 days after the infusion, she developed mild ideo-motor slowing, dysgraphia, and drowsiness. Despite specific treatment with dexamethasone, her neurological status progressively worsened to a comatose state within 24 h. EEG and CSF analyses were non-specific, showing background slowing and inflammatory findings. Brain MRI revealed multiple focal punctate areas of T2-weighted hyperintensity localized in the body and isthmus of the corpus callosum. Following the administration of high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone, her neurological status resolved within 48 h. Notably, the follow-up brain MRI did not reveal any abnormalities in the corpus callosum, except for a reduction of fractional anisotropy. Conclusion Reversible punctate inflammatory foci of the body and isthmus of the corpus callosum may represent a novel radiological finding of CAR T-cell therapy-related neurotoxicity.\",\n",

       " 'Objectives Spinocerebellar ataxia 27 (SCA 27) is a rare heredodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in the fibroblast growth factor 14 FGF14 Methods At baseline, we studied the effects of high-frequency VIM stimulation and low-frequency stimulation of subthalamic projections on tremor and ataxia. The patient then adopted the best individual high-frequency stimulation programme at daytime and either 30 Hz-stimulation of the subthalamic contacts or StimOFF at night during two separate 5-weeks follow-up intervals. Both patient and rater were blinded to the stimulation settings. Results High-frequency stimulation of the VIM effectively attenuated tremor. At follow-up, intermittent 30 Hz-stimulation at night resulted in a superior tremor response compared to StimOFF at night. Ataxia was not affected. Discussion Stimulation of the VIM and adjacent subthalamic projections effectively attenuated tremor in a patient with confirmed SCA 27. Cycling between daytime high-frequency and night-time low-frequency stimulation led to a more sustained tremor response. This suggests to study in future if low-frequency stimulation of the subthalamic projection fibers may help overcome tolerance of tremor that is observed as a long-term limitation of VIM-DBS.',\n",

The presence of neuropsychiatric symptomatology associated with basal ganglia calcifications identifies a clinical entity defined as Fahr's Disease. This term is used in presence of calcifications secondary to a specific cause, but the variability of etiology, pathogenesis, and clinical picture underlying this condition have raised the question of the real existence of a syndrome. Several classifications based on the etiology, the location of brain calcifications and the clinical presentation have been proposed. Method In the present study, we describe the case of a 52 years old man with a Bipolar I disorder diagnosis and a recent onset of behavioral disinhibition and alcohol misuse. The patient came to our center, specialized for bipolar disorder, as a consequence of a progressive worsening of the clinical picture associated to behavioral disturbances (sexual disinhibition, episodes of binge-eating, alcohol misuse), initial degrees of deterioration in cognitive function, peculiar psychotic symptoms and a resistance to various psychopharmacological treatment. The patient underwent neuro-psychologic evaluation, laboratory examinations and neuroimaging. Results and Conclusions CT and MRI revealed basal ganglia calcification and, in presence of normal blood tests, a diagnosis of Fahr's syndrome was suggested. During the hospitalization, the patient showed a good clinical response to a psychopharmacological therapy constituted by two mood stabilizers (lithium carbonate and oxcarbazepine) and mild antipsychotics doses (quetiapine and aripiprazole). Finally, we performed a literature review on the complex and multifaceted neuropsychiatric clinical manifestations of Fahr's disease in order to provide useful elements in terms of etiology, clinical manifestation, diagnosis, and treatment.\",\n",

However, there is no recognition in the current literature of a clear link between paraproteinaemia and primary brain tumours such as glioma. We present 3 cases of classical IgM paraproteinaemic neuropathy who developed glioblastoma in the course of their illness following treatment with chemoimmunotherapy (CIT). Due to the progressive symptomatic nature of their neuropathy, all 3 patients were treated with CIT. The patients presented with glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype at 9 months, 5 years, and 6 years following treatment completion. None of the patients had unequivocal evidence of known predisposing factors for glioblastoma. Both disorders are exceedingly rare and the chance of random association is less than one in a million. Potential common pathogenic mechanisms include the influence of paraproteins and circulating lymphoplasmacytic cells on blood-brain permeability and CNS immune micro-environment as well as raised circulating angiogenic cytokines such as vascular endothelial growth factor. In cases with anti-myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) antibodies, surface MAG on glial cells may act as a target releasing cells from growth inhibition. We suggest that all glioblastoma cases be screened at diagnosis for serum paraproteins and that such cases be reported to central registries to establish the frequency of the association more accurately.\",\n",

While opsoclonus, which is involuntary chaotic rapid eye movements, is not a common manifestation of GBS. Moreover, little published data are available on the relation between liver enzymes elevation and GBS. Case presentation A 42-year-old man presented to Al Mouwassat University Hospital with weakness in all limbs and dyspnea. Examination showed an elevated respiratory rate, hyporeflexia, and decreased strength of upper and lower limbs. Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid revealed an albuminocyto-dissociation suggesting the diagnosis of GBS and subsequent plasmapheresis. NCS confirmed a diagnosis of AMSAN. Elevation in liver enzymes was noticed prompting further exploration with no positive findings. Despite treatment efforts, the patient developed severe dyspnea, deterioration in cognitive abilities, and opsoclonus with a normal brain MRI. Unfortunately, he developed respiratory failure which lead to his death. Conclusion In this case, we highlight the occurrence of opsoclonus which is a rarely-encountered manifestation of GBS, in addition to an unexplained elevated liver enzyme, the thing that could contribute to larger research to further comprehend the pathophysiology of GBS.

Case Presentation A 58-year-old male with known co-morbid hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus presented to the emergency room with complaints of worsening shortness of breath, dry cough, and fever for the past 10 days. On day 20 of hospitalization, he developed neurological symptoms after being tested positive for COVID-19. A neuroelectrophysiology study was conducted to evaluate neurological symptoms and suggested that the patient suffers from acute motor-sensory axonal polyneuropathy (AMSAN). CSF analysis showed elevated protein levels that confirmed the diagnosis of GBS. He was subsequently treated with oral prednisolone and IVIG, which improved neurological symptoms. Conclusion Ever since the emergence of COVID-19, GBS has surfaced as to its potentially dangerous outcome. Healthcare professionals should be mindful of GBS and should rule it out in anyone having sensory symptoms or weakness during or after a COVID-19 infection.

Case Report: We describe a 28-year old female who initially presented with headaches, behavioral changes, anxiety, lip tremors, and rigidity of extremities. She was prescribed with olanzapine and later manifested with neuroleptic malignant syndrome symptoms such as decrease in sensorium, muscle rigidity, hyperthermia and tachycardia. Further investigation showed presence of bilateral ovarian teratoma and anti-NMDAR antibodies in her serum and cerebrospinal fluid. Symptoms resolved after intravenous high-dose methylprednisolone, bilateral oophoro-cystectomy, and intravenous immunoglobulin administration. Overlapping pathological mechanisms of anti- NMDAR encephalitis and NMS were discussed. Ten patients with anti- NMDAR encephalitis and NMS were noted in a review of literature. Prognosis was favorable and intervention ranged from supportive to methylprednisolone and intravenous immunoglobulin administration, plasma exchange and teratoma resection. Conclusion: Anti- NMDAR encephalitis patients are at risk for NMS due to antipsychotic intolerance and other interrelated pathophysiological mechanisms. The overlap between the signs and symptoms of anti-NMDAR encephalitis and NMS poses a diagnostic dilemma and warrants a careful investigation and management.',\n",

This rare leukodystrophy syndrome with mutations in the GFAP gene could present with developmental delay and seizure in the infantile form to ataxia and bulbar palsy in adulthood. However, psychiatric symptoms are not well-defined and are usually evaluated after disease diagnosis, not before disease investigations. Case Report: Our patient is a 52-year-old Iranian woman with a history of depression since 17 years ago, a suicidal attempt two years ago, and ingestion of a large amount of opium with the intention of suicide 2 months ago. She was presented with disorientation and probably a delirious state in the last interview. Eventually, in comprehensive investigations, white matter hyperintensity in MRI and leukodystrophy was diagnosed to determine the cause of these changes, we did a gene study, found whole exon deletion of the GFAP gene, and made a diagnosis of late-onset Alexander disease. Conclusion: Neurological-onset manifestation of Alexander disease, specifically late-onset form, is the most common clinical picture of disease and was seen in about 90% of patients, but psychiatric symptoms are not well-known, and psychiatric-onset disease was not described yet. Various gene mutations were described in late-onset Alexander disease; however, the large whole exon deletion which was revealed in our patient is a novel mutation and significantly needs to be explored. Here authors describe a late-onset Alexander disease with psychiatric-onset symptoms and novel large exon deletion in the GFAP gene. Highlights Alexander disease is a rare heterogeneous disorder that could have various symptoms of the central nervous system involvement. The whole-exons deletion of the GFAP gene in an adult patient with features of Alexander disease is the first Gene mutation that was revealed in this case. Psychiatric onset Alexander disease is the one differential diagnosis in the patients with atypical psychiatric symptoms combined with soft neurological signs. Neurologic consultation and appropriate imaging and laboratory procedures could help early diagnosis and potential treatment.

       " \"Background A cervical arteriovenous fistula (AVF) in neurofibromatosis type I (NF-1) is uncommon, and it brings challenges and difficulty in treatment. Case Presentation A 39-year-old woman was diagnosed with an NF-1-associated spontaneous vertebral artery-internal jugular vein-spinal vein fistula. The fistula was placed by coil embolization. Postoperative examination showed that the fistula closure was satisfied, and the patient's abnormal clinical manifestation disappeared without any complications after 24 months of interventional embolization. As per the literature, interventional embolization is currently the main treatment method, and it has the distinguishing features of less trauma, quick recovery, and a good prognosis. Conclusion NF-1 associated with a spontaneous arteriovenous fistula is rare in clinical practice, which carries significant challenges in treatment, but can be effectively treated using endovascular embolism. Endovascular embolism could be the potential choice of treatment in NF-1 associated with AVF.\",\n",

Additionally, the long-term effects of metallic foreign bodies on deep brain stimulation (DBS) are unknown. A 79-year-old man with a 5-year history of Parkinson's disease (PD) reported that, 40 years ago, while playing with a pistol, a metallic bullet was accidentally discharged into the left brain through the edge of the left eye, causing no discomfort other than blurry vision in the left eye. DBS was performed due to the short duration of efficacy for oral medication. Because the bullet was on the left subthalamic nucleus (STN) electrode trajectory and the patient's right limb was primarily stiff, the patient received globus pallidus interna (GPi)-DBS implantation in the left hemisphere and STN-DBS implantation in the right hemisphere.

       " 'Introduction Sodium Fluorescein has become a validated and widely used fluorescent dye in neuro-oncological surgery, thanks to its ability to accumulate in cerebral with a damaged blood–brain barrier. It concentrates at the tumor site, enhancing the lesion, and helps in the discrimination between tumor and normal brain parenchyma. Research question This dye has a very well described profile of safeness, as a result of several applications in ophthalmology and, in recent years, also in neurosurgery. To date, no reviews are available on collateral effects of sodium fluorescein application in neurosurgery. Material and methods The case of a young woman who underwent a potentially toxic dose (almost 3Â â\\x80\\x8bg) of sodium fluroescein administration during anesthesia induction for a glioma surgery due to a medical error is presented, along with a review of available articles relates to collateral effects of sodium fluorescein in neurosurgery. Results No toxic clinical phenomena occurred, and the microsurgical procedure was completed, achieving tumor gross total resection. Procedure resulted challenging due to an intense basal hyper-fluorescence, making difficult the visualization of brain tissues and the discrimination between normal brain and tumor. Discussion and conclusions The good clinical and laboratory outcome of this patient further strengthens the idea that fluorescein-guided removal of brain tumors may be considered safe, beyond effective. By now, this is the first report of an erroneous so high dose administration of sodium fluorescein during a neurosurgical procedure and the first review of neurosurgical-reported collateral effects.',\n",

The tES-generated electric field (EF) within the brain is considered as one of the most important factors for physiological effects. However, it is still unclear how brain lesions may influence EF distribution induced by tES. In this case study, we reported in vivo measurements of EF in one epilepsy participant with brain lesions during different tES montages. With the in vivo EF data measured by implanted stereo-electroencephalography (sEEG) electrodes, the simulation model was investigated and validated. Our results demonstrate that the prediction ability of the current simulation model may be degraded in the lesioned human brain.',\n",

Patients often present with CSF rhinorrhea, recurrent meningitis, chronic headache, and visual defects, while few patients have been reported to present with neuroendocrine alterations. Endonasal endoscopic repair is the first-line treatment for these leaks at present. However, the relatively high risk of recurrence remains the main cause of reoperation because of elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) after endoscopic surgery and absence of postoperative ICP management. A shunting procedure may stop CSF leakage or relieve symptoms in complex cases, and this is presently well-known as the last-line therapy for CSF liquorrhea. We describe a 29-year-old woman with spontaneous CSF rhinorrhea and neuroendocrine alterations due to IIH, and with no previous history of trauma, tumor, or nasal surgery.

Given the nature and extent of the damage, cognitive and functional deficits are typically chronic even after standard therapies. Here, we describe a novel treatment approach that used high definition transcranial direct-current stimulation (HD-tDCS) with a 62-year-old male who was 5 years post-anoxic leukoencephalopathy secondary to an accidental drug overdose. HD-tDCS was administered over the left lateral prefrontal cortex across 29 daily sessions at 2 mA (20 minutes/session) in order to address dysexecutive behaviors. Results demonstrated improved delayed memory and trends for improved visuospatial and semantic fluency performance as well as improved insight and daily functioning, all of which returned to baseline by the end of a 10 week no-contact follow up period. Resting state fMRI connectivity results mirrored these changes by showing increased dorsal attention and cingulo-opercular but reduced ventral attention network connectivity after session 29, all of which returned to baseline at follow-up. These findings suggest HD-tDCS may benefit functioning even following serious and pervasive anoxic injury. Findings also suggest the need for continued HD-tDCS for maintenance purposes, though future work is needed to identify optimal dose-response information.',\n",

Due to its rarity, the diagnosis of spinal neurocysticercosis may be missed. Case presentation We describe a 37-year-old female patient who developed back pain and lower extremity weakness and was found to have an intramedullary thoracic spine cystic lesion. She was taken to the operating room for resection of the lesion. Pathology revealed a larval cyst wall consistent with neurocysticercosis. The patient was started on albendazole and dexamethasone. Her exam improved post-operatively, and she was able to ambulate with minimal difficulty at the time of follow up. Conclusion The case provides insights on the diagnosis and treatment of isolated intramedullary spinal neurocysticercosis. Review of the literature suggests that combined surgical and medical intervention results in significant improvement in the patient's neurological exam, and decreases morbidity associated with the disease.

Background Functional neurological disorders represent conditions without a readily identifiable origin or laboratory-supported diagnostic. We report a case of functional neurological disorder, presenting with muscle weakness with alterations in F-waves on the affected side. Case report A retrospective case review of a patient seen in clinic. Electrophysiological evaluation included nerve conduction studies, including recording of F-waves in lower limbs, and needle EMG. A patchy sensory loss and unilateral muscle weakness of the left lower limb persisted nine days after a 40-year-old female patient developed bilateral lower limb weakness following a laparoscopic surgery. MRI was negative for radicular compression, myelopathy, or lumbosacral plexopathy. F-waves of the peroneal and tibial nerves on the left were absent or of reduced persistence and amplitude compared to the asymptomatic right side. Significance The observation of unilateral alterations of F-wave parameters could be interpreted as an asymmetrical decrease of alpha motor neuron excitability on L4 – S2 segments. In the absence of peripheral nervous system dysfunction or a structural lesion, the results here suggest a central control dysfunction or point to a more complex peripheral role. Further research is necessary to determine the frequency of these findings in a larger group of patients while incorporating other late responses, such as H (Hoffman) reflex, and measures of cortical excitability.',\n",

A better low-profile visualized intraluminal support expansion was achieved by simultaneously pushing the wire and the system within the Atlas placed at the aneurysm neck, which resulted in an increased metal coverage of the aneurysm neck and a shorter transition zone with low metal coverage at both ends of the aneurysm neck.

This patient—a 77-year-old man with symmetrical limb weakness, diffuse demyelination determined by a nerve conduction study, and lacking autoantibodies—was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin and experienced severe fluctuations in symptoms. We transitioned him to subcutaneous immunoglobulin: his serum immunoglobulin G levels stabilised and he experienced symptomatic relief.

Neurosurgical procedures resulting in CSDH are a rare clinical complication, and there was no report about how subdural effusion (SDE) evolves into CSDH after deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery. The formation mechanism of CSDH after surgery, especially in DBS surgery, and the effect of recovery, need to be explored. Methods: We present two cases, complicated with SDE after DBS surgery, serious dysfunction complications such as hemiplegia and aphasia occurred on the postoperative day 36 and 49 individually, and images showed CSDH. Fusion image showed the bilateral electrodes were significantly shifted. Then, they were performed to drill craniotomy with a closed system drainage. Result: The symptoms of hemiplegia and aphasia caused by CSDH were completely recovered, and the follow-up images showed CSDH was disappeared. However, DBS stimulation is poorly effective, it cannot reach the preoperative level, especially in the ipsilateral side of CSDH. Conclusions: The iatrogenic SDE that evolved into CSDH in the present two cases shows that SDE is one of the causes of CSDH. Patients develop SDE after DBS, which increases the risk of developing CSDH. CSDH after DBS can be successfully treated. however, the postoperative efficacy of DBS will decline.',\n",

Methods Four paragangliomas were treated with percutaneous embolization using NHCA as the sole embolic material. In one dural arteriovenous fistula (dAVF), NHCA was used in combination with other embolic materials. Procedural specifics, complications and angiographic results were retrospectively evaluated. Results Total or subtotal devascularization was obtained in 3 of the 4 paragangliomas. In the largest tumor, only partial devascularization could be achieved. The dAVF was completely occluded. Catheter entrapment did not occur. After dAVF treatment, the patient had an asymptomatic lacunar infarction, while there was no procedural morbidity related to paraganglioma treatment. Conclusions In this series, neurovascular embolization with NHCA was feasible and effective. It may be particularly beneficial for small and tortuous vessels that require low-profile catheterization and a slow and controlled polymerization.

Cases Reported We describe here the clinical, radiological, electrophysiological, and biological evolution of three patients. Two women aged 73 and 72 years and a 69-year-old man presented with complex cognitive and focal neurological symptoms and each had a predominant frontal dysexecutive involvement and an unexpectedly high titer of anti-MAG antibodies in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The question of an autoimmune cause was raised. After 2 years of follow-up and, for two of them, without improvement despite immunosuppressive treatments, diagnoses of NDD were eventually retained: post-radiation encephalopathy, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and Alzheimer's disease. Conclusion The presence of a high titer of anti-MAG antibodies may be found in NDD. It could reflect cerebral tissue damages, particularly in the case of significant frontal involvement. Atypical presentations may lead to a search for a paraneoplastic neurologic syndrome or AIE. However, the indirect immunofluorescence staining positivity on a monkey cerebellum section linked with anti-MAG antibodies should not lead to those diagnoses being retained.\",\n",

Following the DBS surgery, some perioperative and even delayed complications due to intracranial and hardware-related events could occur, which may be life-threatening and require immediate remedial measures. Clinical Presentation We report a case of an older woman with advanced PD who developed the unique complication of unilateral cyst formation at the tip of the DBS electrode after undergoing bilateral placement of subthalamic nucleus DBS. After a period of controlled motor symptoms, the patient showed new neurological deficits related to right peri-lead edema. However, the new neurological symptoms regressed quickly over several days with stereotactic implantation of a puncture needle to drain the cyst fluid without removing the affected lead. Conclusion The occurrence of an intraparenchymal cyst following DBS surgery is a rare but life-threatening complication that could relate to edema around the electrodes or cerebrospinal fluid tracking. Stereotactic aspiration makes the intracranial cyst regress safely and effectively and ensures that the electrode is in the optimal position of the target nucleus to achieve an effective DBS surgery.\",\n",

Curvilinear hyperintensity along the corticomedullary junction on diffusion-weighted images (DWI) is a vital clue for diagnosing NIID. DWI hyperintensity tends to show an anterior-to-posterior propagation pattern as the disease progresses. The rare cases of its disappearance may lead to misdiagnosis. Here, we reported a NIID patient with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like (MELAS-like) episode, and reversible DWI hyperintensities. A review of the literature on NIID with MELAS-like episodes was conducted. A 69-year-old woman stated to our clinics for recurrent nausea/vomiting, mixed aphasia, altered mental status, and muscle weakness for 2 weeks. Neurological examination showed impaired mental attention and reaction capacity, miosis, mixed aphasia, decreased muscle strength in limbs, and reduced tendon reflex. Blood tests were unremarkable. The serological examination was positive for antibody against dipeptidyl-peptidase-like protein 6 (DPPX) (1:32). Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed hyperintensities in the left temporal occipitoparietal lobe on DWI and correspondingly elevated lactate peak in the identified restricted diffusion area on magnetic resonance spectroscopy, mimicking the image of MELAS. Skin biopsy and genetic testing confirmed the diagnosis of NIID. Pulse intravenous methylprednisolone and oral prednisolone were administered, ameliorating her condition with improved neuroimages.

       " \"Background Guillain-BarrÃ¨ syndrome (GBS) is an acute immune-mediated disorder affecting peripheral nerves and nerve roots with a variable clinical course and outcome. Epidemiologic analyses have revealed that the incidence of the syndrome increases linearly among the age. The clinical diagnosis of GBS is based on the family history, physical and neurological examination, electrodiagnostic exams, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis with the classical presence of albumin-cytologic dissociation. Prognosis is associated with the severity of clinical signs and the type of peripheral nerves involved. Methods This study aims to clarify which clinical features can be used for prognostic purposes. We evaluated the correlation between (1) brain MRI lesions and grade of disability; (2) brain MRI lesions and elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein; and (3) increased levels of CSF protein and grade of disability. Statistical analysis extracted from these data indicated a good correlation to be a prognostic indicator in children affected by GBS. We found little evidence regarding laboratory tests, imaging, and prognosis. We enrolled 12 continuous patients who met the Brighton criteria for GBS in this retrospective study. Each patient was clinically evaluated at the time of disease onset to assess the GBS disability score and after 2 weeks. Results We estimated Pearson's correlation index to evaluate the possible correlation between MRI and disability and CSF protein levels and disability. The correlation coefficient was 0.92 and 0.85, respectively. In addition, we developed a graph to see the trend of the disability values, proteins in the CSF, and damage assessed with MRI in the 12 patients. It seems that these parameters have a parallel trend and a good correlation in each patient. Finally, we calculated the correlation between MRI and CSF protein values, with an r Conclusion The MRI and CSF laboratory parameters can be important tools for the clinician not only for diagnosis but also to evaluate the possible worsening of general conditions or the need to prepare measures to support life parameters.

       " 'Introduction Low back pain (LBP) is the most prevalent form of chronic pain in active-duty military personnel worldwide. Electroacupuncture (EA) and neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) are the two most widely used treatment methods in the military, while evidence for their benefits is lacking. The aim of this randomized clinical trial is to investigate the effectiveness of EA vs. NMES in reducing pain intensity among active-duty navy personals with chronic LBP. Methods The study is designed as a single-center, randomized controlled trial. The primary outcome is a positive categorical response for treatment success in the first-time follow-up, which is predesignated as a two-point or greater decrease in the NRS score and combined with a score > 3 on the treatment satisfaction scale. The secondary outcomes include pain intensity, rate of treatment success, and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) fear-avoidance beliefs questionnaire (FABQ) score along with muscular performance. The first follow-up starts on the first day after completing the last treatment session, and then the 4-weeks and 12-weeks follow-up are applied via Results Eighty-five subjects complete the treatment diagram and are included in the analysis. For the primary outcome, no difference has been found between EA and NMES, with 65.1% (28 in 43) individuals reporting a positive response to EA treatment, while 53.5% (23 in 43) in NMES. However, for longer follow-ups, superiority in positive response of EA has been found in 4-weeks (26 in 39, 66.7% vs. 16 in 40, 40%; P P Conclusion Both the EA and NMES are associated with a positive response in treating military LBP, and the former offers lasting benefits in the later follow-ups. Thus, electroacupuncture is a more recommended treatment for military LBP.

       " 'Agoraphobia has been defined as marked fear or anxiety being in enclosed or open places, using public transportation, and being in a crowd or outside of home alone. Such individuals make active attempts to avoid those places which cause intense distress. The neuronal areas that play a significant role in agoraphobia are uncinate fasciculus, which connects the prefrontal lobe and amygdala and various alterations in anterior cingulate cortex, insula, amygdala, and lateral prefrontal cortex. Neurofeedback is a type of biofeedback which teaches self-control of brain functions by measuring brain waves with the help of electroencephalography (EEG) and providing a feedback signal. With the help of alpha and beta training protocol, neurofeedback therapy will help in enhancing the connectivity between prefrontal cortex and amygdala. The present study aims to explore the therapeutic effectiveness of neurofeedback therapy as an adjunct treatment with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in patients with agoraphobia disorder. A single case study method was adopted. The patient having the symptoms of agoraphobia disorder diagnosed as per ICD-10 criteria was taken in the study. After going through detailed case history and mental status examination, the patient was assessed on psychological measures on baseline and other follow-up visits. A total of 18 therapeutic sessions of neurofeedback therapy (alpha and beta protocol) along with CBT were conducted. Intermittent assessments on Draw A Person Test (DAPT), EEG parameters, Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), and Panic and Agoraphobia Scale (PAS) were conducted to compare the pre- and post-assessment findings. The results indicated significant improvement in the symptoms of the patient after intervention. The pre- and post-assessment findings and the neurofeedback therapy along with CBT were observed to be effective in treating the symptoms of agoraphobia. Neurofeedback therapy and CBT were proven to be effective in removing the symptoms of agoraphobia disorder within the patient.',\n",

Her prior ophthalmic evaluations were consistent with an isolated left trochlear nerve paresis. She had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showing multiple foci of T1-weighted hyperintensities around the midbrain and brainstem thought to represent subarachnoid fat from a ruptured dermoid cyst. An extensive evaluation revealed a left trochlear nerve paresis as well as diminished sensation in the distributions of the first and second divisions of the left trigeminal nerve. Review of her MRI and history of myelograms raised the possibility of focal inflammation from intrathecal iophendylate (PantopaqueÂ®). Repeat MRI was obtained that showed T1-weighted hyperintensities similar to her previous MRI, but in this study, T1-weighted fat suppression imaging also was performed and revealed these foci to be of low signal intensity, consistent with retained iophendylate.',\n",

       " 'Background Polymicrogyria refers to the disruption of normal cerebral cortical development late in neuronal migration or in early cortical organization. Although patients with polymicrogyria feature relatively favorable motor outcomes, polymicrogyric lesions accompanied by extensive unilateral hemispheric atrophy and ipsilateral brainstem atrophy may induce poorer motor outcomes. This study is the first to employ transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to characterize changes to motor organization and white matter tracts induced by polymicrogyria. Case presentation We document a case of a 16-year-old female with left hemiplegic unilateral polymicrogyria associated with ipsilateral brainstem atrophy. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed unilateral polymicrogyria to have affected anterior cortical areas, including the perisylvian region on the right side. The right halves of the brain and brainstem were significantly smaller than the left halves. Although our patient was found to exhibit cortical dysplasia of the right frontoparietal and sylvian fissure areas and a decreased number of fibers in the corticospinal tract (CST) of the affected side on DTI, the connectivity of the CST was preserved up to the motor cortex. We also measured the cross-sectional area of the CST at the level of the pons. In TMS, contralateral motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were evoked from both hands, but the ipsilateral MEPs were evoked only from the left hand. The left hand featured a long duration, polyphasic pattern of contralateral MEPs. Discussion and conclusion TMS revealed that the concurrent bilateral projections to the paretic hand from the affected and unaffected hemispheres and contralateral MEPs in the paretic hand were polyphasic, indicating delayed electrophysiological maturation or a pathologic condition of the corticospinal motor pathways. In DTI, the cross-sectional area of the CST at the level of the pons on the affected side was smaller than that on the unaffected side. These DTI findings reveal an inadequate CST volume. Despite extensive brain malformation and ipsilateral brainstem atrophy, our patient had less severe motor dysfunction and presented with involuntary mirror movements. Mirror movements in the paretic hand are considered to indicate ipsilateral corticospinal projections from the unaffected hemisphere and may suggest favorable motor outcomes in early brain injury.',\n",

Patients with NIID may present with heterogeneous clinical symptoms, including episodic encephalopathy, dementia, limb weakness, cerebellar ataxia, and autonomic dysfunction. Among the NIID cases reported in China, patients often have complicated and severe manifestations. Therefore, many clinicians do not consider the disease when the patient presents with relatively minor complaints. Case presentation We present the case of a 39-year-old man showing migraine-aura-like symptoms for the past 3Â years. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed hyperintense signals in the splenium of the corpus callosum and corticomedullary junction on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) over time. In addition, brain atrophy that was not concomitant with the patient's age was detected while retrospectively reviewing the patient's imaging results. Genetic analysis and skin biopsy confirmed a diagnosis of NIID. The patient was treated with sibelium, and the symptoms did not recur. Discussion and Conclusions Migraine-aura-like symptoms may be the predominant clinical presentation in young patients with NIID. Persistent high-intensity signals on DWI in the brain and early-onset brain atrophy might be clues for the diagnosis of NIID.\",\n",

Here we present a rare case of a young patient with extensive brain stem lesion on the MRI while exhibiting nystagmus, singultus and somnolence. Case presentation A 30-year-old male patient presented initially with fever and impaired consciousness, but furthermore developed nystagmus, singultus and tetraparesis during the following week. Repeated MRI examinations revealed extensive brain stem edema with notable bilateral affection of the cerebellar peduncles and the pons. Antiviral and antibiotic treatment was changed to intravenous corticosteroids and immunoglobulins as soon as the diagnosis of MOGAD was established by testing serum and cerebrospinal fluid positive for MOG specific antibodies. MRI alterations vanished completely over time with a delayed, nearly complete clinical recovery of our patient. Conclusion Brain stem affection in MOGAD is rare.

Case description A 59-year-old woman was admitted to an Emergency Department about and hour and a half after she was found with altered mental status. Her initial symptoms were psychomotor agitation and slight confusion. No evident focal neurological deficit was observed at that time and computed tomography was negative. After acute drug intoxication was excluded, a transfer to a psychiatric unit was considered. Simultaneously, short stenosis of the left posterior cerebral artery was diagnosed with the use of computed tomography angiography. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed bilateral acute ischemia of the medial parts of the thalamus, and immediate thrombolysis and thrombectomy treatment was initiated. Both procedures were successful and the patient was discharged in good general condition. Comment Psychomotor agitation may be an atypical manifestation of a bilateral thalamic ischemia.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed prominent bilateral periventricular white-matter lesions, hydrocephalus, ischemic stroke with gadolinium enhancement of frontoparietal and basilar meninges on contrast-enhanced fluid-attenuated inversion recovery. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) showed narrowing of the bilateral middle cerebral arteries. Based on these findings, we diagnosed the patient with neurosarcoidosis.

Background Essential tremor (ET) is one of the most common movement disorders, and continuous deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established treatment for medication-refractory cases. However, the need for increasing stimulation intensities, with unpleasant side effects, and DBS tolerance over time can be problematic. The advent of novel DBS devices now provides the opportunity to longitudinally record LFPs using the implanted pulse generator, which opens up possibilities to implement adaptive DBS algorithms in a real-life setting. Methods Here we report a case of thalamic LFP activity recorded using a commercially available sensing-enabled DBS pulse generator (Medtronic Percept PC). Results In the OFF-stimulation condition, a peak tremor frequency of 3.8â\\x80¯Hz was identified during tremor evoking movements as assessed by video and accelerometers. Activity at the same and supraharmonic frequency was seen in the frequency spectrum of the LFP data from the left vim nucleus during motor tasks. Coherence analysis showed that peripherally recorded tremor was coherent with the LFP signal at the tremor frequency and supraharmonic frequency. Conclusion This is the first report of recorded tremor-related thalamic activity using the electrodes and pulse generator of an implanted DBS system.

This study aimed to report the clinical course, imaging features, and therapeutic response of MOG-IgG-associated cortical/brainstem encephalitis. Methods Data of four patients who suffered from cortical encephalitis with epileptic seizures and/or brainstem encephalitis during the course of the disease were retrospectively collected and analyzed. Results In this study, three male patients and one female patient, with a median age of onset of 21 years (ranging 20–51 years) were enrolled. An epileptic seizure was the main symptom of cortical encephalitis in these patients, while the manifestations of brainstem encephalitis were diverse. Cranial MRI demonstrated abnormal signals in unilateral or bilateral cortical or brainstem. Cerebrospinal fluid studies showed normal or mildly elevated leukocyte counts and protein levels, and a cell-based assay detected positive MOG-IgG in the serum of all patients. Two patients were misdiagnosed at the first attack, and both experienced a relapse. All of them accepted the first-line immunotherapy after a confirmed diagnosis and had a good outcome. Conclusion Early suspicion of MOG-IgG-associated encephalitis is necessary for any patient with sudden onset of seizures or symptoms of brainstem damage, especially with lesions on unilateral/bilateral cortical or brainstem on brain MRI.',\n",

Hardware exposure is often associated with the development of infection that can lead to implant removal. However, in selected cases, it is possible to manage skin erosion without having to remove the hardware. This article presents the case of a patient with recurrent skin erosions above the IPG, who underwent multiple surgeries. Given the failure of less invasive approaches, a more complex surgery with the employment of a pedunculated flap of pectoralis major in order to cover the IPG was attempted. Nevertheless, the IPG removal was finally unavoidable, resulting in a rapid decline in clinical performance. This illustrative case suggests how, in patients with sustained stimulation who benefit from a good degree of autonomy, it may be useful to use invasive surgical techniques to resolve skin erosions and save the DBS system. In spite of everything, sometimes complete or partial removal of the implant still becomes unavoidable, but this can lead to a severe worsening of PD symptoms. Definitive removal of the system should therefore be considered only in cases of frank infection or after failure of all other approaches.',\n",

       " 'Background The COVID-19 disease can affect subjects suffering from myasthenia gravis (MG) and worsen its clinical course, leading to intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Critically ill subjects can develop a neuromuscular complication called ICU-acquired weakness (ICUAW). This disorder has also been detected in ICU subjects with COVID-19, but the association between MG and ICUAW has never been described in critically ill patients. We describe the case and functional outcome of a COVID-19 patient suffering from MG who developed critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP). Case Presentation A 66-year-old man with a history of hypertension and ocular MG had COVID-19 and required ICU admission. The patient underwent mechanical ventilation and tracheotomy and was treated with remdesivir and corticosteroids. Fifteen days after admission, he complained of tetraparesis without the ocular involvement that remained unchanged despite the increase in anticholinesterase therapy. The length of stay (LOS) in ICU was 35 days. On day 2 of admission, the patient underwent a frontal muscle jitter study that confirmed the MG, and electroneurography (ENG) and electromyography (EMG) that showed overlapping ICUAW with electrophysiological signs characteristic of CIP. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed normal pressure, cell count, and protein levels (<45 mg/dl) without albumin-cytologic disassociation. The CSF/serum glucose ratio was normal. The CSF culture for possible organisms, laboratory tests for autoimmune disorders, the panel of antiganglioside antibodies, and the paraneoplastic syndrome were negative. Strength and functional outcomes were tested with the MRC scale, the DRS, Barthel scale, and the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) at admission, discharge, and follow-up. Muscular strength improved progressively, and the MRC scale sum-score was 50 at discharge. Anticholinesterase therapy with pyridostigmine at a dosage of 30 mg 3 times daily, which the patient was taking before COVID-19, was resumed. His motor abilities recovered, and functional evaluations showed full recovery at follow-up. Conclusion In the described subject, the coexistence of both neuromuscular disorders did not affect the clinical course and recovery, but the question remains about generalization to all patients with MG. The rehabilitation interventions might have facilitated the outcome.',\n",

In the present study, we report three NMOSD cases associated with cancer, which are teratoma and lung adenocarcinoma, teratoma, and transverse colon adenocarcinoma, respectively. Pathological staining of tumor sections revealed a high AQP4 expression. After tumor removal, all cases were stable and suffered no further relapses, which revealed the potential paraneoplastic mechanism between cancer and NMOSD. One of our patient's serum AQP4-IgG was transiently slightly elevated even though AQP4 was highly expressed in tumor cells, which indicates that AQP4 is not the main pathogenic antibody but might be induced by other underlying pathogenic antibody–antigen reactions.\",\n",

Perioperative, cerebral blood flow and oxygenation can be monitored in different ways, but there is no clear evidence of a gold standard and a uniform guideline is lacking. Electroencephalography and near-infrared spectroscopy are among the most frequently used methods of neuromonitoring. Clinicians should be aware of their pitfalls and the added value of transcranial doppler. Case presentation We present the case of an 85-year old male with perioperative haemodynamic stroke during carotid endarterectomy. Ischemic stroke was caused by suddenly increased carotid stenosis resulting in major neurologic deficit. This was registered only by transcranial doppler, while surface electroencephalography and near-infrared spectroscopy failed to detect any significant change in cerebral perfusion, despite a large perfusion defect on computed tomography. Circulation was restored with endovascular treatment and neurologic deficit quickly resolved.

       " \"Background Diagnosis of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is challenging as initial presentations are various and diagnostic biomarkers are lacking. The diagnosis relies on the presence of both upper and lower motor neuron signs and thorough exclusion of differential diagnoses, particularly as receiving an ALS diagnosis has major implications for the patient. SjÃ¶gren's syndrome may mimic peripheral ALS phenotypes and should be considered in the work-up. Case A 72-year-old female presented with a mono-neuropathy of the right leg and a complaint of dry eyes and mouth. Initial diagnostic work-up confirmed a regional sensorimotor neuropathy and a SjÃ¶gren's syndrome; a causal relationship was assumed. However, motor symptoms spread progressively despite immunosuppressive treatment, eventually including both legs, both arms and the diaphragm. Clinically, unequivocal central signs were lacking, but further along in the disease course, the atrophy pattern followed a split phenotype and deep tendon reflexes were preserved. Nerve biopsy did not show vasculitic infiltration; however, serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL) concentrations were and remained persistently highly elevated despite immunosuppressive treatment. Electrodiagnostic re-evaluation confirmed denervation in 3 regions. A diagnosis of familial ALS was finally confirmed by a C9 orf Discussion Our instructive case shows the difficulties of diagnosing ALS in the setting of a peripheral symptom onset and a concurrent but unrelated condition also causing neuropathy. Such cases require high clinical vigilance and readiness to reappraise diagnostic findings if the disease course deviates from expectation. Recently proposed simplified diagnostic criteria, genetic testing and body fluid biomarkers such as sNfL may facilitate the diagnostic process and lead to an earlier diagnosis of ALS.\",\n",

It is characterized by heterogeneous features such as intellectual disability, facial dysmorphisms, poor feeding, vision abnormalities, musculoskeletal anomalies, congenital heart and genitourinary system defects, as well as several unique neurological findings including seizures, tone abnormalities, autism spectrum disorder and variable brain abnormalities noted on neuroimaging. Unfortunately, we lack adequate information regarding the spectrum of these neurological symptoms. In this study, we report 2 new unrelated cases of ZTTK syndrome, and identify new pathogenic variants in the SON gene through microarray analysis and whole-exome sequencing. We also emphasize the neurological manifestations of the syndrome in our patients and discuss the significance of gathering more data regarding neurological presentation, particularly seizure characteristics and long-term developmental progression. This information will be crucial to help understand long-term neurodevelopmental prognosis in these patients.',\n",
       " 'ABSTRACT Ischaemic optic neuropathy is the most common, feared, and recognised ocular manifestation of giant cell arteritis (GCA), while extraocular muscle palsy rarely occurs in the disease. Overlooking the diagnosis of GCA in aged patients with acquired diplopia and strabismus is not only sight– but also life-threatening. Here, we present, for the first time, a case of unilateral abducens nerve palsy and contralateral anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy as the presenting signs of GCA in a 98-year-old woman. Prompt diagnosis and treatment prevented further visual loss and systemic complications and allowed for rapid resolution of the abducens nerve palsy. We also aim to discuss the possible pathophysiological mechanisms of diplopia in GCA and to emphasise that acquired cranial nerve palsy must raise suspicion of this severe disease in elderly patients, particularly in association with ischaemic optic neuropathy.',\n",
       " 'Introduction: In the midst of the coronavirus disease of 2019 pandemic, active immunization by effective vaccination gained utmost importance in terms of global health.

Case Report: We report a 43-year-old previously healthy female with an optic neuritis attack 24 hours following immunization with the second dose of coronavirus disease of 2019 mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine. A second transverse myelitis attack together with an elevated anti-AQP-4 antibody titer confirmed the diagnosis of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder. Conclusion: Our case identifies the BNT162b2 vaccine as a possible trigger for neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder. This rare and potentially coincidental event has no implications for vaccine administration practices.

       " 'ABSTRACT We report a 64-year-old male patient without any contributory medical history who visited the eye clinic due to right-sided headache for 1Â month and then loss of vision for 3Â days. The clinical presentation suggested a cavernous sinus syndrome and acute optic nerve ischaemia in his right eye. The left eye was normal. Orbit and brain magnetic resonance (MR) imaging demonstrated restricted diffusion of the posterior orbital segment of the right optic nerve, suggesting an acute posterior ischaemic optic neuropathy. Three-dimensional time-of-flight MR angiography showed high flow in the right cavernous sinus, indicating a carotid cavernous fistula (CCF). In the arterial phase of digital subtraction angiography (DSA), a fistula in the right cavernous sinus was revealed which was fed by meningeal branches from both the external and internal carotid arteries, confirming an indirect CCF. The origin of the right ophthalmic artery was seen, but its branches were not detected. Right common carotid artery DSA showed a superior ophthalmic vein occlusion and the drainage vein of the CCF ran through the inferior petrosal sinus to the internal jugular vein. The right cavernous sinus was embolised using platinum coils and glue to occlude the feeding vessels from the branches of both the external and internal carotid arteries. Post-embolisation imaging showed complete closure of the fistula.',\n",
       " 'Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders are characterized by severe demyelination and axonal damage with autoimmune mechanisms, predominantly targeting the optic nerves and the spinal cord. Patients often test positive for anti-AQP4 antibodies, while some have anti-MOG antibodies. Double seropositivity has been described, with a variable prevalence (0 to 26%) dependent on the testing method. The clinical significance of double seropositivity remains unclear. We present the case of a 65-year-old patient, admitted to our clinic with optical neuritis, followed up approximately 10 days later by cervical myelitis, who tested positive for both anti-AQP4 and anti-MOG antibodies. The clinical onset coincided with a mild form of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The neurological symptoms were initially relatively subdued, which delayed the diagnosis. The patient was not vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. The clinical picture was compatible with an anti-AQP4 phenotype. The patient was started on corticosteroid therapy, under which the clinical response was good. Our case reinforces the idea that SARS-CoV-2 can precipitate autoimmune demyelinating diseases since SARS-CoV-2 infection has already been demonstrated as a risk factor for NMOSD relapses. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of double seropositive neuromyelitis optica associated with COVID-19. We expect that in the near future, as the true burden of COVID becomes clearer, we shall encounter other cases which can trace their apparent clinical onset to a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Careful attention should be paid to the apparent minor neurological symptoms of COVID-19.',\n",

Data collected from the patients for analysis included general patient history, the fluctuation and severity of disease symptoms, the indicated therapies and disease progression at follow-up. All patients had histories of sudden withdrawal or reduction of levodopa prior to the onset of symptoms. Clinical presentations were characterized by hyperthermia, autonomic dysfunction, worsening of extrapyramidal symptoms, and elevated serum creatine kinase (CK) levels. During hospitalization, one patient rapidly progressed and died, while the other two patients were successfully treated.

The logopenic variant, characterized by impairments of word retrieval and sentence repetition along with preserved semantic, syntactic, and motor speech abilities, is the most recently described and remains less understood than other variants due to a comparatively small number of case studies and a lack of investigations with a thorough specification. In this article, we report a 2-year follow-up case study of a 74-year-old Chinese female patient with a logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia, including its neurolinguistic study, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and 11C-Pittsburgh compound B-Positron emission tomography imaging analyses, as well as gene sequencing. This case confirms that, in addition to word-finding and sentence repetition difficulties, the logopenic variant may also present with mild auditory comprehension and naming deficits attributed to impaired access to lexical representations.

       " \"Peripheral nerve injuries (PNIs) that consist of simple nerve severance often result in severe motor impairment and permanent loss of function. Such patients face significant costs and pose major burdens to healthcare systems. Currently, the most promising surgical technique to achieve the best clinical outcome after such PNIs is immediate primary coaptation of severed nerve ends by microsutures (neurorrhaphy). However, recovery is often poor and delayed for many months due to Wallerian degeneration (WD) and slow (1–2 mm/day) axonal outgrowths from severed proximal axons that may not properly reinnervate denervated afferent/efferent targets that have atrophied. In contrast, recent pre-clinical studies using polyethylene glycol (PEG) to facilitate primary nerve repair have greatly improved the rate and extent of sensory and motor recovery and prevented much WD and muscle atrophy. That is, PEG-fused axons rapidly establish proximal–distal axoplasmic/axolemmal continuity, which do not undergo WD and maintain the structure and function of neuromuscular junction (NMJ). PEG-fused axons rapidly reinnervate denervated NMJs, thereby preventing muscle atrophy associated with monthslong denervation due to slowly regenerating axonal outgrowths. We now describe PEG-mediated fusion repair of a digital nerve in each of two patients presenting with a digital laceration resulting in total loss of sensation. The first patient's tactile perception improved markedly at 3 days postoperatively (PO). Two-point discrimination improved from greater than 10 mm at initial presentation to 4 mm at 11-week PO, and the Semmes–Weinstein monofilament score improved from greater than 6.65 to 2.83 mm, a near-normal level. The second patient had severe PO edema and scar development requiring a hand compression glove and scar massage, which began improving at 11-week PO. The sensory function then improved for 4 months PO, with both two-point discrimination and Semmes–Weinstein scores approaching near-normal levels at the final follow-up. These case study data are consistent with data from animal models. All these data suggest that PEG-fusion technologies could produce a paradigm shift from the current clinical practice of waiting days to months to repair ablation PNIs with autografts, anucleated nerve allografts, or conduits in which the patient outcome is solely dependent upon axon regeneration over months or years.\",\n",

Case presentation A 29-year-old male patient with a history of Graves' disease with hyperthyroidism presented to our hospital with head trauma of cerebral contusion and laceration in both frontal lobes confirmed by admission CT scan. He received mannitol to lower intracranial pressure, haemostatic therapy, and antiepileptic treatment. Eight days later, he presented with signs of thyroid storms, such as tachycardia, hyperthermia, sweating and irritation, and his thyroid function tests revealed high levels of TPO-Ab, TR-Ab, TG-Ab, FT3 and FT4. Then, he entered a deep coma. His brain CT showed a thrombosis of multiple venous sinuses, along with the opening of peripheral collateral vessels, congestive infarction with haemorrhage and brain swelling. He regained consciousness after treatment with antithyroid drugs, anticoagulants, respiratory support and a regimen of sedation/analgesia. After a half-year follow-up, most of the patient's blocked cerebral venous sinuses had been recanalized, but there were still some sequelae, such as an impaired fine motor performance of the right hand and verbal expression defects. Conclusions CVST can be induced by thyroid storms, and trauma-related thyroid storms can develop on the basis of hyperthyroidism. The purpose of this case report is to raise clinicians' awareness and improve their ability to diagnose CVST early in patients with traumatic brain injury complicating thyroid storms to improve the neurological prognosis among similar patients.\",\n",

The efficacy of eculizumab in an acute relapse of NMOSD however is still under review. Case We describe a 46 year-old female who presented with acute left monocular vision loss on a background of bilateral optic neuritis treated 15 years prior as suspected NMOSD. She had very poor vision from the right eye (6/60). On presentation she was not on any long-term immunosuppressive agents. Her serum was positive for AQP4-IgG and MRI brain and spine demonstrated areas of demyelination in the corpus callosum and thoracic spine. She was treated with high dose intravenous methylprednisolone and underwent plasmapheresis for five consecutive days, but continued to clinically deteriorate with ongoing blindness in her left eye (light perception only). She was subsequently administered eculizumab with weaning oral corticosteroids. Clinically her vision improved to counting fingers and she remains on maintenance eculizumab infusions in the community. At 3 months, there is a steady improvement but still significant loss of central vision from that eye. Conclusion The utility of eculizumab in NMOSD may assist with treating acute episodes. This theoretically accords with the mode of action in inhibiting conversion of C5–C5a/b, perhaps arresting the acute inflammatory process in this disease. Given that disease burden and mortality in NMOSD is almost entirely related to relapses, increased use of eculizumab acutely could potentially aid recovery from an attack in very severe attacks, and therefore minimize immediate stepwise accrual of disability.',\n",

       " 'Glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibodies are associated with disabling conditions such as stiff person syndrome, temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), limbic encephalitis, cerebellar ataxia (CA), and ocular movement disorders, which are usually chronic and difficult to treat. GAD-related TLE has poor response to anti-seizure medications and immune therapies, and epilepsy surgery is rarely successful. We report on a 47-year-old female with history of migraine, autoimmune thyroid disease, ankylosing spondylitis, and drug-resistant TLE. A video electroencephalography recorded frequent seizures with temporo-insular semiology, correlating to left temporal epileptiform activity and left mesiotemporal hyperintensity on magnetic resonance imaging. GAD autoimmunity was confirmed by very high GAD antibody titers in serum and cerebrospinal fluid. Steroids, immunoglobulins, and cyclophosphamide had no effect, and selective left amygdalectomy was performed based on very restricted hypermetabolism on positron-emission tomography. After transient seizure freedom, significant epilepsy improvement was observed in spite of memory decline. Transient worsening was noted 1 year later during diabetes mellitus manifestation and 5 years later during presentation of progressive CA, which stabilized on rituximab treatment. We believe this case illustrates the diversity and the frequent overlap of GAD-associated disorders, the need of early and aggressive immunotherapy in severe patients, as well as the possible benefit from epilepsy surgery in some GAD-TLE.',\n",

Although medullary lesions have occurred in patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), there are few reports of SSS associated with NMOSD. We report a patient with NMOSD who developed refractory nausea, vomiting and SSS as the initial manifestation. Case presentation A 77-year-old female developed refractory nausea and frequent episodes of syncope. The patient was diagnosed with SSS because sinus pauses lasting five to six seconds were observed, and pacemaker implantation was performed. Two months later, she was referred to our hospital because of limb weakness and sensory impairment that progressed over a month. The patient was confirmed to have muscle weakness; manual muscle testing revealed grade 4 in the upper extremities and grade 3 in the lower extremities. Tendon reflexes were diminished, while no pathological reflexes were present. Thermal and pain sensations were impaired in the upper and lower extremities, and vibration sensation was impaired in both lower extremities. Bladder and rectal disturbances were also noted. Optic neuritis was not detected. T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed high-intensity lesions in the dorsal part of the medulla oblongata and C3–6 cervical cord.

       " 'COVID-19 may increase the risk of acute ischemic stroke that can cause a loss of upper limb function, even in patients with low risk factors. However, only individual cases have been reported assessing different degrees of hospitalization outcomes. Therefore, outpatient recovery profiles during rehabilitation interventions are needed to better understand neuroplasticity mechanisms required for upper limb motor recovery. Here, we report the progression of physiological and clinical outcomes during upper limb rehabilitation of a 41-year-old patient, without any stroke risk factors, which presented a stroke on the same day as being diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient, who presented hemiparesis with incomplete motor recovery after conventional treatment, participated in a clinical trial consisting of an experimental brain-computer interface (BCI) therapy focused on upper limb rehabilitation during the chronic stage of stroke. Clinical and physiological features were measured throughout the intervention, including the Fugl-Meyer Assessment for the Upper Extremity (FMA-UE), Action Research Arm Test (ARAT), the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), corticospinal excitability using transcranial magnetic stimulation, cortical activity with electroencephalography, and upper limb strength. After the intervention, the patient gained 8 points and 24 points of FMA-UE and ARAT, respectively, along with a reduction of one point of MAS. In addition, grip and pinch strength doubled. Corticospinal excitability of the affected hemisphere increased while it decreased in the unaffected hemisphere. Moreover, cortical activity became more pronounced in the affected hemisphere during movement intention of the paralyzed hand. Recovery was higher compared to that reported in other BCI interventions in stroke and was due to a reengagement of the primary motor cortex of the affected hemisphere during hand motor control. This suggests that patients with stroke related to COVID-19 may benefit from a BCI intervention and highlights the possibility of a significant recovery in these patients, even in the chronic stage of stroke.',\n",

We describe a patient with sporadic adult-onset NIID but without any high-intensity signal on DWI and T2-weighted imaging (T2WI). Case presentation A 58-year-old woman without special family history developed mild persistent tremor in the right hand and deteriorated 2â\\x80\\x89years later. At 60â\\x80\\x89years of age, the patient began to conceive the bank, police and internet being deceptive, further presented apathy and confusion after two and a half years, as well as fabrication of non-existent things. Despite the treatment of antipsychotic drugs due to a diagnosis of mental disorder, the patient appeared weakness in the right limbs. Neurological examination revealed mutism, resting tremor, cogwheel-like rigidity in upper limbs, and weakness in all limbs. Brain magnetic resonance imaging displayed no cerebral atrophy initially but atrophy of frontal, temporal and parietal lobes 5â\\x80\\x89years later. No any high-intensity signal on DWI and T2WI was revealed.

       " \"Myxoma is the most common type of benign cardiac tumor in adults, and it has a strong tendency to embolize or metastasize to distant organs. Patients with multiple brain metastases have rarely been seen in clinics; hence, standard treatment protocols for multimyxoma metastasis in the brain have not been established. We present the case of a 47-year-old female who had convulsions in the right hand and repeated seizures. Computed tomography revealed multiple tumor sites in her brain. Craniotomy was conducted to remove the tumor sites. However, recurrent brain tumors and unexpected cerebral infarctions occurred frequently shortly after the treatment because the cardiac myxoma had not been treated due to the patient's personal concerns. The myxoma was resected by gamma knife radiosurgery, and temozolomide was given prior to cardiac surgery. There has been no evidence of tumor recurrence from the 2 years following the surgery until the present. This case highlights the importance of prioritizing cardiac lesions over cerebral lesions; if a cerebral metastasis has been found, it is likely that the cardiac myxoma is already unstable, with high rates of spread and metastasis. Therefore, it is unwise to treat metastasis sites before the cardiac myxoma. Additionally, the case suggests that gamma knife radiosurgery combined with temozolomide is effective as treatment for multiple myxoma metastasis in the brain. Compared with conventional cerebral surgery, gamma knife radiosurgery is safer, causes less bleeding, and requires a shorter time for recovery.\",\n",
       " \"(1) Objective: To investigate the feasibility, safety, and effectiveness of a brain–computer interface (BCI) system with visual and motor feedback in limb and brain function rehabilitation after stroke. (2) Methods: First, we recruited three hemiplegic stroke patients to perform rehabilitation training using a BCI system with visual and motor feedback for two consecutive days (four sessions) to verify the feasibility and safety of the system. Then, we recruited five other hemiplegic stroke patients for rehabilitation training (6 days a week, lasting for 12–14 days) using the same BCI system to verify the effectiveness. The mean and Cohen's w were used to compare the changes in limb motor and brain functions before and after training. (3) Results: In the feasibility verification, the continuous motor state switching time (CMSST) of the three patients was 17.8 Â± 21.0s, and the motor state percentages (MSPs) in the upper and lower limb training were 52.6 Â± 25.7% and 72.4 Â± 24.0%, respectively. The effective training revolutions (ETRs) per minute were 25.8 Â± 13.0 for upper limb and 24.8 Â± 6.4 for lower limb. There were no adverse events during the training process. Compared with the baseline, the motor function indices of the five patients were improved, including sitting balance ability, upper limb Fugel–Meyer assessment (FMA), lower limb FMA, 6 min walking distance, modified Barthel index, and root mean square (RMS) value of triceps surae, which increased by 0.4, 8.0, 5.4, 11.4, 7.0, and 0.9, respectively, and all had large effect sizes (Cohen's w â\\x89¥ 0.5). The brain function indices of the five patients, including the amplitudes of the motor evoked potentials (MEP) on the non-lesion side and lesion side, increased by 3.6 and 3.7, respectively; the latency of MEP on the non-lesion side was shortened by 2.6 ms, and all had large effect sizes (Cohen's w â\\x89¥ 0.5). (4) Conclusions: The BCI system with visual and motor feedback is applicable in active rehabilitation training of stroke patients with hemiplegia, and the pilot results show potential multidimensional benefits after a short course of treatment.\",\n",
       " 'Autoimmune encephalitis (AE) frequently presents with seizures in the acute setting.

       " 'Purpose The aim of this study was to examine the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow rates in the subarachnoid space (SAS) of the optic nerve (ON) and the brain in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and papilledema (PE) compared to healthy controls by applying non-invasive diffusion-weighted MRI. Methods A retrospective analysis of diffusion-weighted MR images of 5 patients with IIH (10 ONs), mean age: 31 Â± 10 years (5 women), and 11 healthy controls (22 ONs, mean age: 60 Â± 13 years, 5 women) was performed. The flow velocity flow-range ratio (FRR) between the intracranial cavity and the SAS of the ON was calculated in both groups and then compared. Results The mean FRR was 0.55 Â± 0.08 in patients with IIH and 0.63 Â± 0.05 in healthy controls. The difference between patients with IIH and healthy controls was statistically significant ( p Conclusions The CSF flow velocity was decreased in patients with IIH with PE compared to healthy controls. The reduced CSF flow dynamics might be involved in the pathophysiology of PE in IIH and diffusion-weighted MRI can be a useful non-invasive tool to study the CSF flow dynamics within the SAS ON. Summary Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is a neurological disease, where vision loss is the most feared complication of this disorder. The pathophysiology of IIH is not fully understood but is strongly linked to a reduced uptake of CSF into the central dural sinus veins. In this study, we examined the CSF flow rates in the SAS ON and the brain in patients with IIH and PE compared to healthy controls by applying non-invasive diffusion-weighted MRI. Knowing about the flow ratio of CSF may be of clinical relevance for the treatment decisions of IIH. If medical treatment fails, surgical options for lowering the ICP pressure need to be taken into consideration. As the primary goal of treatment is to prevent the loss of vision and visual field, it is important to know whether the communication of CSF between the intracranial CSF and the CSF in the perioptic space is intact. We showed that the CSF flow velocity was decreased in IIH patients with PE compared to healthy controls. The reduced CSF flow might be involved in the pathophysiology of PE in IIH, and diffusion-weighted MRI can be a useful non-invasive tool to study the CSF flow dynamics within the SAS ON.',\n",
       " 'A 36-year-old nullipara at 35 weeks of gestation woke up with slurred speech and dysphagia. The next day, she developed abruption of the placenta, underwent an acute cesarean, and was diagnosed with severe preeclampsia. Neurologic examination revealed flaccid dysarthria, bilateral soft palate palsy, reduced taste of the left posterior tongue, left-sided tongue deviation, and paralysis of the left sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles. MRI revealed left-sided tongue edema compatible with acute left hypoglossal nerve denervation and electromyography of the left trapezius and glossal muscles showed profuse denervation potentials. In conclusion, multiple cranial neuropathies may occur in and even be a presenting symptom of preeclampsia. In this study, we report the first case of multiple cranial neuropathies involving cranial nerves IX, X, XI, and XII in a patient with preeclampsia. Possible pathogenic mechanisms of cranial neuropathy in preeclampsia include immune-mediated neuropathy with or without demyelination, microvascular thromboses, and perineural edema.',\n",

       " 'Background Transverse myelitis (TM) is characterized by acute development of motor, sensory and autonomic dysfunctions due to horizontally diffused inflammation in one or more segments of the spinal cord in the absence of a compressive lesion. The not well-known inflammation process induces demyelination resulting in neurological dysfunction. Case presentation In this case report we used a functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) technique to evaluate changes in the peri-spinal vascular response induced by a peripheral median nerve electrical stimulation in a patient with chronic transverse myelitis (TM). fNIRS showed drastically reduced signal amplitude in the peri-spinal vascular response, compared to that obtained from a healthy control group throughout most of the C7-T1 and T10-L2 spinal cord segments. Conclusion The potential use of this relatively non-invasive fNIRS technology support the potential clinical application of this method for functional test of the spinal cord through the assessment of the spinal neurovascular response.',\n",
       " 'Patients with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) in the context of human immunodeficiency virus-acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV-AIDS) show a partial improvement following rehabilitation; however, this improvement is rapidly lost if the patient is not provided with intensive rehabilitation. A 42-year-old patient affected by HIV-AIDS had a clinical worsening within a few months following PML onset, despite being treated with antiretroviral drugs and conventional rehabilitation. He developed severe paraparesis and significant dependency in the activities of daily life. A first cycle of intensive rehabilitation provided the patient with some significant functional outcomes, although he experienced a worsening of the clinical condition after two months of rest, before admission to our rehabilitation unit. We thus sought to evaluate the effects of intensive robot-aided gait training (RAGT) coupled with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). The patient significantly improved when provided with intensive RAGT coupled with tDCS (as per 10-meter Walk Test [10MWT] and 6-minute Walk Test [6MWT]), and the improvement was maintained at three-month follow-up. As this advanced approach was feasible, safe, and potentially effective, this case suggests that patients with PML-HIV require prolonged multidisciplinary rehabilitation treatment. We can speculate that individuals with PML should also be treated with innovative technology to improve their functional outcomes and therefore quality of life.',\n",

At age of 51, aggravating migraine-like attacks co-occurred with a sudden encephalopathy-like episode. Brain MRI showed right cerebral edema and cortical enhancement. Serum lactic acid level was elevated at rest and significantly increased after a simplified serum lactic acid exercise test. The initial diagnosis was MELAS, while NIID was suspected after faint DWI high-intensity signals in the corticomedullary junction was retrospectively recognized. Mitochondrial genome sequencing and gene panel analysis of nuclear genes related to mitochondrial diseases failed to find any causative variants. Repeat-primed PCR and fluorescence amplicon length PCR of NOTCH2NLC NOTCH2NLC Conclusion NIID should be taken into account for differential diagnosis of migraines and MELAS-like episodes. Besides the corticomedullary hyperintensity on DWI, cortical enhancement in contrast-enhanced brain MRI may also be a brain image marker for the differential diagnosis between MELAS and NIID with MELAS-like episodes.\",\n",
       " 'Background Cerebral resuscitation determines the prognosis for patients who have experienced sudden death, and brain protection is the focus of clinical treatment. Cerebral resuscitation depends on the timing and quality of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). At present, cerebral oxygen monitoring is used mainly to monitor the quality of external cardiac compression and provide a prognosis for the nervous system. However, after the return of autonomous circulation, it is necessary to conduct continuous monitoring to ensure measures are taken timeously since hemodynamic instability, brain edema, and other factors may cause occult brain injury, and invasive arterial pressure cannot represent cerebral perfusion. Case presentation By using continuous cerebral oxygen monitoring after CPR and the return of spontaneous circulation, a patient who was witnessed to have experienced sudden death in the hospital was found to have insufficient cerebral perfusion; he underwent timely intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation to improve his hemodynamics and cerebral perfusion. The patient went on to achieve a good neurological prognosis. Conclusion Cerebral oxygen monitoring should be conducted throughout the treatment period; physicians should understand cerebral perfusion in real time and implement timely intervention measures to reduce occult brain injury and improve the neurological prognosis of patients.',\n",
       " 'Background and Objectives To describe a new case of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) induced by the administration of interferon-alpha (IFNÎ±) and to raise awareness of this rare drug-induced disease of IFNÎ± treatment. Methods A single case study and comprehensive literature review of eight cases. Results A 24-year-old man was diagnosed with cerebral venous thrombosis and essential thrombocythemia. He had been undergoing IFNÎ± treatment (IFNÎ±-2b, 3 million IU per day) without any side effects for 18 months, at which point the patient developed persistent hiccups, nausea, urinary retention, and numbness. Spinal magnetic resonance imaging revealed a longitudinal abnormality extending from the medulla to the entire spinal cord. The patient was positive for anti-aquaporin-4 antibody (AQP4-IgG) in both the serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which confirmed the diagnosis of NMOSD. Thus, recombinant IFNÎ±-2b was suspended immediately. Because his condition did not improve after 6-day treatment of methylprednisolone pulse therapy (1,000 mg for 3 days, then 500 mg for 3 days), intravenous immunoglobulin (0.4 g/kg/day for 5 days) was administered. The patient gradually improved. Low-dose prednisolone and mycophenolate mofetil were subsequently administered as a long-term treatment. The patient was discharged with subtle limb numbness and their expanded disability status score (EDSS) was 1. At the 1-year follow-up, the patient had not relapsed and tested negative for AQP4-IgG. We further identified the eight patients with IFNÎ±-induced NMOSD. The median onset age was 59 years, and the median time of IFNÎ± exposure was 18 months. Optic neuritis was the most common initial symptom (five, 55.6%), followed by myelitis in three patients and area postrema syndrome in one patient. More than half (five, 55.6%) of the patients were monophasic. After IFNÎ± discontinuation and immunotherapy, most (seven, 77.8%) patients remained relapse-free. However, only one patient was free of sequelae. Conclusion This study highlights the potential pathogenic risk of NMOSD of IFNÎ± treatment. Given the high disability rates of this rare drug-induced disease, it is crucial to monitor the early manifestations of NMOSD during IFNÎ± treatment.',\n",

The retinal territory supplied by the affected cilioretinal artery was hypoperfused, yet this retinal territory at least partially corresponded to the only preserved visual field in that eye. The sector of the optic disc corresponding to the emergence of the cilioretinal artery was the only sector spared by pallid edema. This pattern of sectoral sparing associated with a cilioretinal artery has been observed in other patients with GCA and in animal models of posterior ciliary artery occlusion. This case serves as a clear example of an incompletely understood phenomenon in posterior pole circulation in vascular occlusive disease that deserves further study.',\n",

       " 'Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies (HSAN) are rare, genetically inherited disorders characterized by impaired unmyelinated nerve fiber function. Here we report a patient with self-mutilation behavior and decreased response to pain, suggestive of an underlying small fiber neuropathy. Nerve conduction studies were normal but sympathetic skin response was absent at the left arm. Intradermal histamine challenge test was performed to evaluate the function of small unmyelinated nerve fibers and revealed absence of a flare response. Using whole genome sequencing, a novel variant in the neurotrophic tyrosine kinase type 1 gene was identified, expanding the known disease-causing variants associated with HSAN type 4. Through this case, we demonstrate the role of the histamine challenge test in patients suspected to have a small fiber neuropathy where electrophysiological testing may be normal and who may present with non-specific symptoms including hypotonia and failure to thrive. The information gained can guide genetic testing and contribute to interpretation of new variants identified.',\n",

We present the case of an 82-year-old woman who presented with a 3-week history of left eye vision loss secondary to bilateral edema and hemorrhage of the optic discs. Despite negative bilateral temporal artery biopsies, the elevation of the inflammatory markers and brain MRA findings suggestive of temporal arteritis as well as stenosis of the basilar artery led us to initiate treatment with high-dose steroids. Inflammatory markers remained elevated despite high-dose steroids which prompted additional work leading to a diagnosis of varicella-zoster encephalitis. Steroid treatment was quickly tapered off and treatment with acyclovir resulted in the normalization of the acute phase reactants. The persistence of elevated inflammatory markers despite high-dose steroids should prompt additional work up for the search of an alternative diagnosis of GCA mimickers.',\n",

We report a large suprasellar extended RCC causing obstructive hydrocephalus, which was efficiently managed by a novel surgical route named \"reverse\" trans-sellar approach using transventricular neuroendoscopy. A 48-year-old woman complained of persistent headache and a tendency to fall that had begun 6 months previously. The images obtained from MRI scan showed intra- and supra-sellar cystic masses occupying the third ventricle with obstruction of the foramina of Monro and the aqueduct of Sylvius. The cystic wall showed a slight enhancement, and the cystic contents showed iso-signal intensity on T1-and T2-weighted images. Instead of trans-nasal trans-sellar surgery, we decided to operate using a conventional transventricular endoscope. A thin cystic capsule, which blocked the foramina of Monro and the aqueduct of Sylvius, was fenestrated and removed and a third ventriculostomy was performed. The defect in the infundibulum between sellar and suprasellar cysts was widened and used as a corridor to drain cystic contents (reverse trans-sellar route). The final pathological finding revealed an RCC with focal metaplasia. We efficiently managed a large RCC by transventricular neuroendoscopic surgery with cyst fenestration and third ventriculostomy and simultaneously drained the sellar contents using a novel surgical route. Reverse trans-sellar neuroendoscopic surgery is a relevant treatment option for selective patients with large suprasellar extensions of RCCs.',\n",

Here, we present a case with anti-MOG positive bilateral optic neuritis and brainstem encephalitis secondary to COVID-19 infection. Additionally, we present a review of the current literature regarding the manifestation of anti-MOG positive optic neuritis as well as anti-MOG positive encephalitis after COVID-19 infection. (2) Case Report: A 59-year-old female patient, with a recent history of COVID-19 infection, presented a progressive reduction of visual acuity and bilateral retrobulbar pain for the last 20 days. An ophthalmological examination revealed a decreased visual acuity (counting fingers) and a bilateral papilledema. An MRI scan of the brain revealed a mild thickening of the bilateral optic nerves and high-intensity lesions in the medial and right lateral pons. A high titer of IgG and IgM antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in serum and antibodies against myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (anti-MOG) in serum and CSF were revealed.

We report on two cases of IEA injury due to femoral venipuncture for neuroendovascular intervention that resulted in hemorrhagic shock and required transcatheter arterial embolization. Case Presentations A 67-year-old woman and a 71-year-old man receiving dual antiplatelet therapy sustained injury to a branch of the IEA in the process of right femoral venipuncture for neuroendovascular intervention. In both cases, stent placement in the intracranial artery was accomplished as intended with systemic heparinization throughout the procedure; however, the patients became hypotensive during the procedure, and contrast-enhanced CT scans taken after the stenting revealed extravasation of contrast from the IEA and retroperitoneal hematoma. Transcatheter arterial embolization of the bleeding branch of the IEA was performed with the left femoral approach, and subsequent angiography confirmed the disappearance of the extravasation of contrast. Conclusion Femoral venipuncture for neuroendovascular intervention in patients receiving antithrombotic agents may cause IEA injury requiring transcatheter arterial embolization. The risk of IEA injury may be reduced by using the femoral head as a reference, performing ultrasound-guided puncture, and confirming the course of the IEA by femoral angiography before venipuncture.',\n",

Over 12-months of CM DBS she had two GTC seizure days, which were in the setting of medication withdrawal and illness, and no GTC seizures in the last 6 months. There was no significant change in the burden of absence seizures. Presently, just two studies clearly document CM DBS in cognitively normal individuals with GGE or idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) [in contrast to studies of cognitively impaired individuals with developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEE)].

Both patients presented with progressive loss of visual acuity, as a result of bilateral optic nerve atrophy, as well as unsteadiness, ataxic gait and hearing loss. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and spine, including gradient echo (GRE) T2-weighted acquisitions, revealed thin optic nerves and strong hypointensity with susceptibility artefacts corresponding to haemosiderin deposits within the meningeal layers of the spine, the infra- and supratentorial spaces of the brain and the peri-optic sheaths in both patients. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was macroscopically haemorrhagic in one patient, who underwent a dynamic myelography, which failed to reveal any trans-dural CSF leakage. Neuro-ophthalmological symptoms due to SS, such as visual acuity loss, have been scarcely reported. MRI using GRE T2-weighted sequences highlighting the presence of haemosiderin deposits plays a key role in the diagnosis of this condition. Treatment should aim at preventing haemosiderin deposition by treating the cause of the subarachnoid bleeding.',\n",

Our report aims to enlarge its phenotypic spectrum to encompass major cognitive disorder with very late onset never before reported in conjunction with neurochondrin antibodies. Methods We describe the case of an 85-year-old woman who presented in our memory clinic. Retrospective analysis of patient records included cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and neuropsychological testing using the CERAD-plus. Results Because of her unknown onset of progressive cognitive dysfunction in conjunction with speech and language problems, we decided to take an extensive differential diagnostic approach including a search for neural autoantibodies potentially involved in cognitive impairment. Our patient presented serum and CSF neurochondrin autoantibodies. Further CSF analysis revealed elevated tau and ptau 181 protein as well as a reduced AÃ\\x9f42/40 ratio in CSF, thus matching a biomarker profile of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Neuropsychological tests revealed predominant and severe deficits in verbal and visual memory. Her MRI showed reduced parietal and cerebellar brain volume. Discussion Taken together, this case reveals the novelty of a patient with a CSF-based and typical clinical and imaging profile of AD. She is also likely to have neurochondrin autoimmunity, as we detected neurochondrin autoantibodies in her CSF; we therefore diagnosed AD dementia associated with neurochondrin antibodies. Our case expands the spectrum of neurochondrin autoimmunity to disorders involving major cognitive disorder such as AD dementia. Furthermore, we speculate that neurochondrin autoimmunity might have triggered an acceleration of AD symptoms as its onset was reported only after a short 6-month interval via a synergistic or negatively additive hybrid mechanism of action between neurodegeneration and autoimmunity.\",\n",

The cervical MRI, in the neutral position, revealed a high T2 signal intensity in the C5â\\x80\\x90C7 cervical myelomeres as well as the loss of cervical lordosis, whereas, during neck flexion, it showed the anterior displacement of the posterior dura ad the postâ\\x80\\x90gadolinium T1â\\x80\\x90weighted imaging enhancement of the posterior epidural plexus. These findings are typical for HD allowing the diagnosis as well as the differential diagnosis from other neuromuscular diseases.',\n",
       " \"Background Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) is a common form of mitochondrial disease. The typical clinical presentation of LHON is subacute, painless loss of vision resulting from bilateral optic nerve atrophy. Moreover, extra-ocular manifestations such as cardiac conduction abnormalities and neurological manifestations such as multiple sclerosis (MS) like disease or parkinsonism are encountered in some patients. Abnormal findings in spinal cord MR imaging or in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have been observed in previous cases of LHON-associated myelopathy. Case presentation We report a male patient with LHON who developed symptoms of myelopathy including gait unsteadiness, enhanced deep tendon reflexes and sensory loss of the lower extremities. Imaging of the brain and spinal cord, CSF analysis, as well as neurography and electromyography did not disclose any abnormalities. The somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) findings were suggestive of dorsal column dysfunction. Conclusions The patient case demonstrates that myelopathy associated with LHON can present without abnormal findings in central nervous system MR imaging or in the CSF, and without evidence suggestive of multiple sclerosis or MS-like disease. The dorsal column seems to be particularly vulnerable to myelopathy changes in LHON. Evoked potential investigations may assist in confirming the diagnosis, when clinical features are in line with myelopathy but findings in CSF analysis and central nervous system imaging are normal.\",\n",
       " \"Body representation disorders are complex, varied, striking, and very disabling in most cases. Deficits of body representation have been described after lesions to multimodal and sensorimotor cortical areas. A few studies have reported the effects of tumors on the representation of the body, but little is known about the changes after tumor resection. Moreover, the impact of brain lesions on the hand size representation has been investigated in few clinical cases. Hands are of special importance, as no other body part has the ability for movement and interaction with the environment that the hands have, and we use them for a multitude of daily activities. Studies with clinical population can add further knowledge into the way hands are represented. Here, we report a single case study of a patient (AM) who was an expert bodybuilder and underwent a surgery to remove a glioblastoma in the left posterior prefrontal and precentral cortex at the level of the hand's motor region. Pre- (20Â days) and post- (4Â months) surgery assessment did not show any motor or cognitive impairments. A hand localization task was used, before and after surgery (12Â months), to measure possible changes of the metric representation of his right hand. Results showed a post-surgery modulation of the typically distorted hand representation, with an overall accuracy improvement, especially on width dimension. These findings support the direct involvement of sensorimotor areas in the implicit representation of the body size and its relevance on defining specific size representation dimensions.\",\n",
       " 'Background Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a rare and occasionally fatal undesirable reaction to dopamine antagonists, and its phenotype is diverse owing to causative drugs. Classically, elevation of serum creatine kinase is described in NMS. Some reports have described muscular pathological findings; however, muscle magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has not been reported previously. Case presentation A 63-year-old woman with a history of schizophrenia presented to our hospital with a high fever, excessive sweating, muscle weakness, and elevated serum creatine kinase levels. Muscle MRI revealed T2 high-intensity lesions in several muscles with gadolinium enhancement, and the pathology of the muscle biopsy showed a very mild presence of muscle fiber necrosis and regeneration with type 2c fibers without inflammation. Her symptoms resolved by treatment with levodopa/carbidopa, dantrolene. Finally, the patient was diagnosed with NMS. Conclusions This is the first report of muscle MRI abnormalities in a patient with NMS. Muscle MRI abnormalities in NMS may be associated with non-inflammatory myopathic changes. The cause of creatine kinase elevation cannot be explained by abnormal strong muscle contraction nor inflammation.',\n",
       " 'Background Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a type of non-invasive brain stimulation technique that has proven effective for neuropsychiatric disorders. Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and depression are common psychiatric disorders that often are comorbid, meaning they occur simultaneously. Current evidence supports the value of tDCS for GAD. The objectives of this report is to explore the effect of tDCS on clinical symptoms and cerebral function in a patient with comorbid GAD and depression. Methods Our subject was a semiprofessional athlete diagnosed with comorbid GAD and depression. Symptoms included palpitations, sweating, continuous tension, and anxiety. We designed a B-A-B experimental protocol and used the Beck Anxiety Index (BAI), Beck Depression Index (BDI), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) as assessment tools. Treatment consisted of 2 series of 15 days each, separated by a 3-week washout period. We collected functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) data before and after both series, as well as fNIRS data immediately after the first treatment in both series. In addition, we collected functional magnetic resonance imaging data before and after the second series. Results After the first series, the scores of the three questionnaires (BAI, BDI and PSQI) decreased significantly, which showed the trend of improvement. The functional connection of bilateral prefrontal partial channels decreased significantly immediately after tDCS treatment. The results of the fNIRS before the second-series treatment showed that prefrontal connectivity returned to the state before the first intervention after the washout period. The results of the fNIRS after the second series treatment showed that the symptoms of depression and anxiety alleviated. The results of the fNIRS showed that the prefrontal connectivity decreased again. Conclusion In the treatment of comorbid GAD and depression, tDCS can alleviate symptoms and improve sleep quality and social behavior. Brain imaging is widely used to observe functional changes by tDCS such as fMRI and fNIRS. The study also showed that fNIRS can be a safe, simple, and efficient method to assess brain activity.',\n",

       " 'Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an essential tool for the study of hypertrophic cardiomyopathies (HCM) and for differentiating HCM from conditions with increased ventricular wall thickness, such as cardiac storage diseases. Although cardiac MRI is already used for the diagnosis and characterization of some forms of storage diseases involving the myocardium, it has not yet been used to study myocardial involvement in neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL). Here, we describe comprehensive cardiac MRI findings in a patient with the CLN3 form of NCL showing basal inferior interventricular septal hypertrophy with maintained indexed LV mass within reference values and low T1-native values. MRI findings support a finding of abnormal storage material within the myocardium in CLN3 disease. We recommend the possible routine use of cardiac MRI for early diagnosis of cardiac involvement in CLN3 disease (also termed juvenile NCL) and to monitor the effects of emerging CLN3 therapies on the myocardium as well.',\n",
       " 'Background Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a rare disease characterized by reversible subcortical vasogenic brain edema. Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is a frequent neurological autoimmune disease that is rarely reported to complicate PRES. Case presentation Here, we report a case of neuromyelitis optica (NMO) concurrent with PRES. A 50-year-old woman presented with severe impairment of her health visual acuity, with significantly worsening of the motor weakness in both lower limbs during methylprednisolone therapy after her diagnosis of NMO. MRI showed new-onset brain edematous lesions of the bilateral frontal, occipital, and parietal lobes. PRES was considered. Her vision impairment and weakness of the extremities were alleviated after antihypertensive treatment and dehydration. The edema lesions detected by MRI also completely disappeared. Conclusions We reviewed 14 cases of NMO with PRES and concluded that the etiology of NMOSD concurrent PRES may be multifactorial, involving pathogenic IgGs against aquaporin-4 (AQP-4) and immunotherapy treatment. Different underlying pathogeneses require different treatment approaches.',\n",

Case report We present a rare case of an adult who hospitalized repeatedly over the past 9 months for persistent pain and numbness in the limbs. This patient was initially diagnosed with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) and treated accordingly, but neurological symptoms did not improve significantly. After this admission, FDG-PET/CT showed focal hypermetabolism of a soft-tissue mass in the nasal cavity, and further lesion biopsy suggested ONB. Combined with positive serum anti-Hu antibody, the diagnosis of PPN associated with ONB was eventually made. Furthermore, the patient's neurological symptoms were relieved after removal of the primary tumor, confirming the accuracy of the diagnosis. Conclusion Our case not only expanded the clinical characteristics of ONB but also highlighted the importance of early and comprehensive tumor screening for the diagnosis of PPN.\",\n",

       " 'Background Neuro-melioidosis, comprising 4% of all cases of melioidosis carries a risk of high morbidity and mortality. We describe two Sri Lankan patients presenting with long segment myelitis secondary to melioidosis. Case presentation Case 1: 47-year-old male presented with right side hemiparesis which progressed rapidly to quadriparesis. Initial cerebro spinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed protein 76Â mg/dl and glucose 72Â mg/dl but without a cellular reaction. MRI spine revealed long segment myelitis with contrast enhancement. The patient was treated with intravenous methyl prednisolone pulses (IV MPP) and plasma exchanges(PLEX) on suspicion of an immune mediated myelitis but without success. A repeat MRI revealed high signal changes in the brain stem and along the entire spinal cord with contrast enhancement. MRI brain after treatment with MPP/PLEX showed enhancing hyper intensities along the corticospinal tracts. The repeat CSF revealed protein 1187Â mg/dl, glucose 78Â mg/dl, lymphocytes 1600/mm3 and neutrophils 10,200/mm3. CSF culture has become positive for Burkholderia pseudomallei Case 2: 47-year-old female presented with bilateral lower limb weakness for 1-week duration. On examination, she had flaccid paraparesis with a sensory level at T11. Inflammatory markers were elevated. CSF analysis revealed protein 50Â mg/dl with lymphocytes 172/mm3. MRI pan spine revealed a long segment myelitis. Serum melioidosis antibody titre was 1: 640. She was treated with IV meropenem for 8Â weeks followed by oral co-trimoxazole with an excellent clinical and radiological response. Conclusion Numerous neurological manifestations have been described with melioidosis, however long segment myelitis with a positive CSF culture is not yet reported. These cases signify the importance of considering melioidosis as a differential in patients with long segment myelitis especially in endemic areas.',\n",

Symptoms typically worsen with upright posture (like standing or sitting upright), head or body motion and exposure to busy or visually rich environments. The article describes the application of Infra-Low Frequency Neurofeedback (ILF NF) over 32 sessions on an unmedicated individual with symptoms related to PPPD that were still present 3 years after the initial diagnosis. Along with significant reduction in those symptoms, other accompanying symptoms (like anxiety, intrusive violent thoughts, suicidal thoughts) were markedly improved with ILF NFB. Consistent symptom tracking from session to session, as well as before and after CPT data were used to document reported changes with ILF NF.',\n",
       " \"Background Neurological symptoms and radiographic abnormalities may remain in a small proportion of patients with metronidazole-induced encephalopathy (MIE). Although experimental animal models of MIE have suggested a Wernicke's encephalopathy-like pathology, little is known about the histopathological features of MIE. Here we report the first autopsy case of irreversible MIE. Case presentation A 72-year-old Japanese woman with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour and metastatic tumours in the liver developed intraabdominal bleeding from a hepatic abscess. She was administered metronidazole for 79 days (1.5Â g/day), which caused dysarthria followed by hand tremor and altered mental status. Brain magnetic resonance imaging at the time of onset revealed hyperintensities in the deep white matter of the bilateral parietal lobes and splenium of the corpus callosum on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) with reduced apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values. Despite the improvement of dysarthria and hand tremor, her cognition remained affected even after the withdrawal of metronidazole. She died of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour at the age of 74 years. Histopathological examinations of the brain confirmed a combination of severe demyelination and moderate axonal degeneration, which corresponded to the regions showing abnormal signal intensities on DWI with reduced ADC values. There were no pathological findings suggestive of Wernicke's encephalopathy in the brain. Conclusion We have demonstrated the clinical, radiographic and histopathological aspects of irreversible MIE. Hyperintensities on DWI with reduced ADC values in affected regions may indicate a poor clinical prognosis due to irreversible pathological damage.

Among rare etiologies, neurosarcoidosis (NS) can cause bilateral involvement (both recurring and simultaneous) only in 15% to 25% of cases. The rarity of this systemic disease and its clinical heterogeneity, due to granulomatous inflammation that may affect many anatomic substrates, frequently make the diagnosis a real challenge for the clinician. Based on laboratory and instrumental tests, a careful diagnostic algorithm must be adopted to avoid misdiagnosis and delay in treatment. We present a 52-year-old woman with an acute onset of unilateral right FNP, rapidly developing contralateral involvement (simultaneous bilateral FNP). Lung findings pointed towards a systemic disease, and then lymph node biopsy confirmed NS. Corticosteroid therapy was started. After three years of follow-up, the patient is still in remission with a low prednisone dose. We discuss the differential diagnosis of bilateral FNP, focusing on clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of NS. We have performed a literature revision, confirming bilateral FNP, outside Heerfordt syndrome, to be rare and sometimes represent the only neurological manifestation of NS onset.',\n",

Following an episode of myelopathy two years before, he had been ambulating with a walker but over two weeks became wheelchair bound. He also developed a sensory level below the T4 dermatome to light touch, pinprick, and vibration. MRI of his cervical and thoracic spine showed a nonenhancing T2 hyperintense lesion extending from C2 to T12. At his presentation two years earlier, he was found to have a longitudinally extensive myelopathy attributed to his LHON. Genetic testing revealed a 3635 guanine to adenine mutation. MRI at that presentation demonstrated a C1-T10 lesion involving the central and posterior cord but, unlike the new lesion, did not involve the ventral and lateral horns. Given the similarity to his prior presentation and a negative evaluation for alternative etiologies, he was thought to have recurrent myelopathy secondary to Leber's Plus. To our knowledge, recurrent myelopathy due specifically to the G3635A mutation in Leber's Plus has not been reported previously.\",\n",

Case presentation We present a case of a 68-year-old woman previously diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) since the 1980s who suffered a rapidly progressive severe sensorimotor paraparesis with loss of bladder and bowel control due to an acute longitudinal extensive transverse myelitis (LETM) after immunization with the mRNA Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. Detection of Aquaporin-4-antibodies (AQP4) in both serum and CSF led to diagnosis of AQP4-antibody positive neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD). Treatment with intravenous corticosteroids and plasmapheresis led to a slight improvement of the patient's symptoms. Conclusions Pathogenic mechanisms of post-vaccination occurrence of NMOSD are still unknown. However, cases like this should make aware of rare neurological disorders manifesting after vaccination and potentially contribute to improvement of management of vaccinating patients with inflammatory CNS disorders in the future. So far two cases of AQP4-antibody positive NMOSD have been reported in association with viral vector COVID-19 vaccines. To our knowledge, we report the first case of AQP4-antibody positive NMOSD after immunization with an mRNA COVID-19-vaccine.\",\n",

Patients often present significant oral self-mutilation manifestations, and biting of the lips, tongue, and cheeks have been frequently reported. This case report describes a case of hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy with oral and cutaneous ulcers. Our patient was a 14-month-old girl with the chief complaint of a tongue ulcer, as stated by her parents, who were referred to our private dental clinic. Clinical examination revealed severe ulcers due to biting (Riga-Fede disease) on the ventral surface of the tongue and superficial ulcers on the dorsal surface of the tongue caused by the anterior maxillary teeth, along with some sores on fingers. The parents were healthy, with no congenital disease or familial history of a similar condition. The electrodiagnostic test revealed the absence of sensory nerve action potential response. However, the electromyographic findings and the compound muscle action potential of the tibial and ulnar nerves were normal. Oral ulcers such as trauma to the lips and tongue, and self-mutilation trauma to the fingers can be used for early detection of Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies. A multidisciplinary approach involving a professional dental team and a regular treatment protocol are imperative to prevent complications of Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies.',\n",

       " 'Neurosyphilis (NS) is an infection of the central nervous system caused by Treponema pallidum. It mimics various neurological and psychiatric diseases. In recent years, there have been several NS cases that manifest as limbic encephalitis (LE). Therefore, the diagnosis of neurosyphilis in the early stages is difficult. Here, we present a case of an NS patient who presented with LE manifestation. The 62-year-old woman presented with acute clinical manifestations of gibberish speech, poor memory, and seizures. Brain MRI showed abnormal signals on the right medial temporal lobe. In addition, the patient had a positive serum leucine-rich glioma inactivated 1 (LGI1) antibody with a titer of 1:16. Therefore, an initial diagnosis of anti-LGI1 encephalitis was made. However, further tests carried out showed positive rapid plasma reagin (RPR), and treponema pallidum particle agglutination (TPPA) tests both in the serum and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Therefore, uncertainty arose as to whether the patient had both anti-LGI1 encephalitis and NS or whether the LGI1 antibody and LE manifestations were due to the NS. The patient was initiated on the recommended dose of penicillin G sodium. Following treatment, the patient reported a significant improvement in clinical symptoms, normal signals in the right temporal lobe, and a negative serum LGI1 antibody. These findings suggested that NS induced the LE manifestations and the production of the LGI1 antibody. This case demonstrates that testing syphilis in patients with LE is important and positive autoimmune encephalitis (AE) antibodies in NS patients need to be viewed and interpreted with greater caution.',\n",

Specifically, several cases of Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome (GBS) have been reported in temporal relationship with COVID-19 vaccination, with two small case series describing a specific phenotype with bifacial weakness and paresthesia in the limbs. Methods We retrospectively collected patients who developed a new-onset neuromuscular disorder in the first 6Â weeks after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine (either first or second dose). The patients were collected from one tertiary care centre and one secondary careÂ centre from February to July 2021. Results We report eight patients who developed phenotypically diverse neuromuscular disorders in the weeks following COVID-19 vaccination, with a presumed immune-mediated etiology. In our case series, we report three patients with classical GBS, one patient with bifacial weakness with paresthesia variant of GBS, two patients with subacute-onset chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), one patient with brachial plexopathy and one patient with subacute axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy.

However, adult patients with severe COVID-19 reportedly present with frequent neuromuscular complications that mainly include critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP), critical illness myopathy (CIM), and focal neuropathies. We examined the records of all paediatric patients with severe COVID-19 who were mechanically ventilated and experienced neuromuscular complications from our single tertiary centre between March 2020 and August 2021. During this period, 4/36 (11%) patients admitted to the paediatric ICU who were mechanically ventilated experienced neuromuscular complications (one CIM, two focal neuropathies, and one CIP associated with plexopathy). In three of them, the gamma genetic variant of SARS-CoV-2 was identified. At the 4–5 month follow-up, three of our patients exhibited slight clinical improvement.

Introduction Prone position during posterior spine surgery can represent a potentially risky procedure for the nervous system. Infrequent injuries due to prone positioning consist of subtle spinal cord infarction or myelopathy that can be promptly detected by intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IONM), if applied in this phase of surgery. Here, we report a case that stresses the value of IONM even in detecting spinal positioning-related neurological complications during kyphoscoliosis correction. Case presentation A 3-year-old child with a severe thoracic kyphoscoliosis with the angle in the tract T5-T6 underwent an early treatment of scoliosis with growing rods. Before instrumentation or the reduction maneuver, lower limb somatosensory and motor responses disappeared. The patient was repositioned with neck and chest in a more protective position and neuromonitoring signals returned to baseline. The surgery could be completed and the patient had no postoperative neurologic or vascular deficits.

The case herein illustrates a complex web of differential diagnosis. The onset, clinical trajectory, treatment course/response, serial neuroimaging findings, and neuropsychological test data were taken into account when assessing a patient presenting 8 months post-COVID-19 (with premorbid attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, diabetes mellitus, mood difficulties, and a positive family history of vascular dementia). Her acute COVID-19 infection was complicated by altered mental status associated with encephalopathy and bacterial pneumonia.

The purpose of her most recent and comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation was to determine the presence/absence of neurocognitive disorder. The patient is a 62-year-old Caucasian woman. Cognitive screening was completed 3 months post-acute COVID-19 as part of an SLP evaluation, and a full neuropsychological evaluation was conducted 8 months post-COVID-19 recovery on an outpatient basis (in person). The patient had serial neuroimaging. Initial neurological evaluation during acute COVID-19 included unremarkable brain computed tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging. However, follow-up CT (without contrast) revealed, in part, \"asymmetric perisylvian atrophy on the left.\" Full neuropsychological evaluation at 8 months post-COVID-19 recovery revealed a dysexecutive syndrome characterized by language dysfunction and affective theory-of-mind deficit, consistent with dementia. There is need for careful use of differential diagnosis in COVID-19 patients with multiple risk factors that make them more susceptible to long-term neurological complications post-COVID-19. Differential diagnosis should involve multidisciplinary assessment (e.g., neuropsychology, SLP, neurology, and psychiatry).',\n",

Nevertheless, emerging evidence shows that neurons do not express the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2, which highlights the importance of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in preventing virus entry to the brain. In this study, we examine the presence of SARS-CoV-2 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and the cytokine profile in cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) from two patients with a brain tumor and COVID-19. To determine the BBB damage, we evaluate the Q- albumin index, which is an indirect parameter to assess the permeability of this structure. The Q-albumin index of the patient with an intraventricular brain tumor suggests that the BBB is undamaged, preventing the passage of SARS-CoV-2 and pro-inflammatory molecules. The development of brain tumors that disrupt the BBB (measured by the Q-albumin index), in this case, a petroclival meningioma (Case 1), allows the free passage of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and probably lets the free transit of pro-inflammatory molecules to the CNS, which leads to a possible activation of the microglia (astrogliosis) and an exacerbated immune response represented by IL-13, IFN-Î³, and IL-2 trying to inhibit both the infection and the carcinogenic process.',\n",

She then received an initial diagnosis of SCD with typical inverted \"V-sigh\" hyperintensities over the posterior aspect of the spinal cord in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI - T2-weighted imaging), as well as megaloblastic anaemia in blood examinations. From the past history, there was no evidence of a dietary deficiency or gastric abnormalities. However, traditional treatment with vitamin B12 supplementation was ineffective. Hence, a demyelinating antibody examination showed that she had antibodies targeting aquaporin 4 (AQP4) in both the cerebrospinal fluid and serum, leading to the diagnosis of NMOSD. Her clinical symptoms were obviously improved after treatment with intravenous glucocorticoids. Conclusion People who have nutritional deficiency or altered gastrointestinal function are more likely to develop SCD.

       " 'Background As the third most common malignancy of childhood, Neuroblastoma has a great propensity to metastasize to multiple organs. The most common site of metastasis is the bone and bone marrow. Concerning the central nervous system, neuroblastoma usually involves the calvarium and the external dural surface. The skull metastases may show different appearances, including: multiple lytic bone lesions, bone thickening, hair-on-end periosteal reaction, irregular suture widening and/or plaque like epidural deposits. Here we present a case of metastatic neuroblastoma, appearing as multiple multi-loculated cystic epidural masses with internal blood-fluid levels as a rare imaging manifestation of calvarial metastasis. Case presentation An 8-year-old boy with known history of autism, presented to the emergency department with a 3-month history of intermittent fever, malaise and myalgia and headache along with significant weight loss. Laboratory examination revealed elevated ESR and CRP and anemia. On Abdomino-Pelvic imaging a well-defined, 45*30*24Â mm, solid-cystic mass was observed, replacing the normal left adrenal gland. On brain MRI, multiple multi-loculated cystic, lentiform masses were observed on the external surface of cerebral hemispheric dura. Multiple fluid–fluid levels were noted in the locules in some of which the dependent fluid was hyperintense on T1w and FLAIR and hypointense on T2w sequences, compatible with blood, representing blood-fluid level. The wall and septa of the masses, enhanced after contrast administration. Associated abnormal marrow signal and aggressive type periosteal reactions were identified in the overlying bone. All of the lesions had increased uptake in MIBG scan. Bone marrow biopsy revealed small round cells, diagnostic for neuroblastoma. The patient underwent chemotherapy treatment. All calvarial/epidural metastatic lesions resolved after chemotherapy and residual adrenal tumor was resected. Conclusion Cystic epidural lesions, especially when associated with adjacent abnormal bone marrow signal, or periosteal reaction and containing blood-fluid level should raise the suspicion of a calvarial metastasis.',\n",
       " 'Background: Central nervous system involvement is uncommon in patients with sarcoidosis. It remains a diagnostic challenge for clinicians, as there is a broad differential diagnosis that matches the presenting neurological signs. Often, the imaging findings also overlap with other disease entities. One understudied finding in patients with neurosarcoidosis is the presence of medullary vein engorgement on SWI imaging, termed the \"medullary vein sign\", which has been postulated to be a specific sign for neurosarcoidosis. This study aims to provide an understanding of the diagnostic potential of the medullary vein sign. Methods: Thirty-two patients who presented with neurologic signs concerning for possible neurosarcoidosis were analyzed retrospectively for the presence of the medullary vein sign. Results: Out of these cases, 7 cases of definitive neurosarcoidosis cases were found based on other imaging signs, biopsy and CSF analysis; the remaining were classified into groups as possible (16), probable (5) and (4) cases of other infectious meningoencephalitis including 2 cases of autoimmune encephalitis. Seven patients among all of these cases were found to have the medullary vein sign on imaging, with five cases with confirmed and two cases from possible neurosarcoidosis. The sensitivity of the medullary vein sign in this study was 71.4%, and the specificity was 92.3%. Discussion: The benefits of improving diagnostic criteria for neurosarcoidosis include more rapid diagnosis leading to more prompt treatment, less exposure to potentially harmful antibiotics or antifungals, and less long-term neurological effects. Our results support that the medullary vein sign will potentially fill in the diagnostic gaps that have challenged the timely diagnosis of neurosarcoidosis. Conclusions: Our findings support that the medullary vein sign has a high specificity and should be included in the diagnostic criteria for neurosarcoidosis.',\n",

Targeting the ventral intermediate nucleus (Vim) is common; however, the outcome is often unsatisfactory, and the posterior subthalamic area (PSA) is expected as alternative target. In this study, we report the case of a patient with intractable Holmes tremor who underwent dual-lead deep brain stimulation (DBS) to stimulate multiple locations in the PSA and thalamus. The patient was a 77-year-old female who complained of severe tremor in her left upper extremity that developed one year after her right thalamic infarction. Vim-thalamotomy using focused ultrasound therapy (FUS) was initially performed but failed to control tremor. Subsequently, we performed DBS using two leads to stimulate four different structures. Accordingly, one lead was implanted with the aim of targeting the ventral oralis nucleus (Vo)/zona incerta (Zi), and the other with the aim of targeting the Vim/prelemniscal radiation (Raprl). Electrode stimulation revealed that Raprl and Zi had obvious effects. Postoperatively, the patient achieved good tremor control without any side effects, which was maintained for two years. Considering that she demonstrated resting, postural, and intention/action tremor, and Vim-thalamotomy by FUS was insufficient for tremor control, complicated pathogenesis was presumed in her symptoms including both the cerebellothalamic and the pallidothalamic pathways. Using the dual-lead DBS technique, we have more choices to adjust the stimulation at multiple sites, where different functional networks are connected. Intractable tremors, such as Holmes tremor, may have complicated pathology, therefore, modulating multiple pathological networks is necessary. We suggest that the dual-lead DBS (Vo/Raprl and Vim/Zi) presented here is safe, technically feasible, and possibly effective for the control of Holmes tremor.',\n",

During his hospitalization, he also complained of right side hearing loss and diplopia. Neurological examination depicted a right IV nerve palsy, ipsilateral facial paresthesia and peripheral facial paresis. Otorinolaryngological examination revealed right vocal cord paralysis. A brain magnetic resonance imaging showed enhancement of the right VII and VIII cranial nerves in the auditory canal. The lumbar puncture revealed increased protein concentration and lymphocytic pleocytosis in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Additionally, a neck computed tomography (CT) scan showed a swollen right supraclavicular lymph node. We hypothesize that the ipsilateral cranial neuropathies of IV, VI, VII, VIII and X, associated with cervical lymphadenopathy, was possible caused by a post-vaccination immune-mediated reaction. The patient was treated with a 5-day course of intravenous methylprednisolone (1000Â mg/day), and a gradual improvement was observed.

In adults, the pathogenesis can be idiopathic, post-infectious or paraneoplastic, the latter etiology belonging to the ever-expanding group of defined paraneoplastic neurological syndromes (PNS). In contrast to other phenotypes of PNS, OMS cannot be ascribed to a single pathogenic autoantibody. Here, we report the first detailed case of paraneoplastic, antibody-negative OMS occurring in association with a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (pNET).

       " \"Background Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is an autoimmune disease that involves damage to the peripheral nervous system. The course of the disease can progress for more than 8Â weeks, with frequent incidences of relapse-remission courses. This article reported a rare combination of CIDP with fluctuating symptoms, recurrence-remission, and comorbidity with psoriasis. Case presentation A 29-year-old male patient with repeated limb weakness and numbness was admitted to the hospital several times in the past six months. He had a history of psoriasis for 6Â years, and the medications (clobetasol propionate ointment and calcipotriol ointment) treated for psoriasis were discontinued 1Â year ago. During the hospitalization, repeated intravenous injections of human immunoglobulin G (IVIg), immunoadsorption, and secukinumab were performed. Nerve electrophysiology tests, ganglioside autoantibody spectrum tests, and clinical MRC muscle strength scores were performed on a regular basis to confirm the diagnosis of CIDP. The patient was regularly followed up. Results After repeated rounds of human IVIg and immunoadsorption, the patient's MRC score was increased byâ\\x80\\x89â\\x89¥â\\x80\\x896 points. The first ganglioside autoantibody spectrum test showed anti-GQ1b IgG (â\\x80\\x89+) and anti-GM1 IgM (â\\x80\\x89+) antibodies, and all were negative after re-examination. Finally, the patient was treated with the IL-17A inhibitor secukinumab for psoriasis. During 7Â months of follow-up, the CIDP and psoriasis symptoms are relatively stable. Conclusion Combination of IVIg and immunoadsorption was highly effective in treating CIDP complicated with psoriasis. The clinical manifestations of CIDP are diverse. When relapse-remission occurs in the course of the disease, it is necessary to clarify whether it is combined with other autoimmune diseases and should control the autoimmune diseases as soon as possible.

       " 'Most spine surgeons and anesthesiologists believe that the risk of spinal cord injury (SCI) during intubation is mainly due to mechanical compression of the spinal cord due to cervical spine movement in cases of undiagnosed but severe cervical lesions. With this reasoning, difficult intubation, which is more frequently encountered in patients with preexisting cervical diseases, is likely to result in SCI. Several reports have described SCI after non-cervical surgery in patients previously diagnosed with cervical myelopathy and a chronically compressed cervical cord; however, to date, there is less acknowledgement of SCI in patients with undiagnosed cervical myelopathy. Here, we report a painful experience of neurological deterioration that developed immediately after elective lumbar decompressive surgery in a 76-year-old man. The possible mechanism behind these unexpected complications is discussed in a review of the literature.',\n",

       " \"Tremor of the upper extremity is a significant cause of disability in some patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). The MS tremor is complex because it contains an ataxic intentional tremor component due to the involvement of the cerebellum and cerebellar outflow pathways by MS plaques, which makes the MS tremor, in general, less responsive to medications or deep brain stimulation (DBS) than those associated with essential tremor or Parkinson's disease. The cerebellar component has been thought to be the main reason for making DBS less effective, although it is not clear whether it is due to the lack of suppression of the ataxic tremor by DBS or else. The goal of this study was to clarify the effect of DBS on cerebellar tremor compared to non-cerebellar tremor in a patient with MS. By wearing an accelerometer on the index finger of each hand, we were able to quantitatively characterize kinetic tremor by frequency and amplitude, with cerebellar ataxia component on one hand and that without cerebellar component on the other hand, at the beginning and end of the hand movement approaching a target at DBS Off and On status. We found that cerebellar tremor surprisingly had as good a response to DBS as the tremor without a cerebellar component, but the function control on cerebellar tremor was not as good due to its distal oscillation, which made the amplitude of tremor increasingly greater as it approached the target. This explains why cerebellar tremor or MS tremor with cerebellar component has a poor functional transformation even with a good percentage of tremor control. This case study provides a better understanding of the effect of DBS on cerebellar tremor and MS tremor by using a wearable device, which could help future studies improve patient selection and outcome prediction for DBS treatment of this disabling tremor.\",\n",

       " 'Long lasting symptoms have been reported in a considerable proportion of patients after a severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. This condition, defined as either \"post-acute coronavirus disease (COVID),\" \"long COVID,\" or \"long-haul COVID,\" has also been described in outpatients and in individuals who are asymptomatic during the acute infection. A possible overlap exists between this condition and the functional neurological disorders (FNDs). We report a 23-year-old man who developed, after asymptomatic COVID-19, a complex symptomatology characterized by fatigue, episodic shortness of breath, nocturnal tachycardia, and chest pain. He also complained of attention and memory difficulties, fluctuating limb dysesthesia, and weakness of his left arm. After neurological examination, a diagnosis of FND was made. Notably, the patient was also evaluated at a post-COVID center and received a diagnosis of long COVID-19 syndrome. After 4 months of psychoanalytic psychotherapy and targeted physical therapy in our center for FNDs, dysesthesia and motor symptoms had resolved, and the subjective cognitive complaints had improved significantly. However, the patient had not fully recovered as mild symptoms persisted limiting physical activities. Long-term post COVID symptoms and FNDs may share underlying biological mechanisms, such as stress and inflammation. Our case suggests that functional symptoms may coexist with the long COVID symptoms and may improve with targeted interventions. In patients presenting with new fluctuating symptoms after SARS-CoV-2 infection, the diagnosis of FNDs should be considered, and the positive clinical signs should be carefully investigated.',\n",

We report a case of multifocal acute cerebral infarctions from meningovascular neurosyphillis in which HR-VWI was instrumental in leading to the etiological diagnosis. A 32-year-old man with history of untreated HIV and polysubstance abuse presented with sudden onset vertigo. CT angiogram of the head and neck showed non-dominant left extracranial vertebral artery occlusion in the V1 segment, and multifocal areas of stenoses in V2 through V4 segments. Non-contrast brain MRI demonstrated multiple small acute infarcts in the left cerebellum, left brachium pontis, medulla and occipital lobe. Rapid plasma reagin was reactive. 3D whole-brain HR-VWI revealed concentric vessel wall contrast enhancement in the left V4 segment, suggestive of inflammation. This HR-VWI finding prompted further investigation with cerebrospinal fluid analysis that revealed reactive fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test. The patient received high-dose intravenous Penicillin G, was restarted on highly active antiretroviral therapy, and remained neurologically stable to-date.

       " 'Supplementary motor area (SMA) syndrome is a typically transient condition resulting from damage to the medial premotor cortex. The exact mechanism of recovery remains unknown but is traditionally described as a process involving functional compensation by the contralateral SMA through corpus callosal fibers. The purpose of this case study is to highlight a distinct extracallosal mechanism of functional recovery from an SMA syndrome in a patient with agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC). We present the clinical presentation and perioperative functional neuroimaging features of a 16-year-old patient with complete ACC who exhibited recovery from an SMA syndrome resulting from surgical resection of a right-sided low-grade glioma. Preoperative fMRI revealed anatomically concordant activation areas during finger and toe tapping tasks bilaterally. Three months after surgery, the patient had fully recovered, and a repeat fMRI revealed shift of the majority of the left toe tapping area from the expected contralateral hemisphere to the ipsilateral left paracentral lobule and SMA. The fMRI signal remodeling observed in this acallosal patient suggests that within-hemisphere plasticity of the healthy hemisphere may constitute an alternative critical process in SMA syndrome resolution and challenges the traditional view that transcallosal fibers are necessary for functional recovery.',\n",
       " 'Background In 2014, we first described novel autoantibodies to the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 1 (ITPR1-IgG/anti-Sj) in patients with autoimmune cerebellar ataxia (ACA) in this journal. Here, we provide a review of the available literature on ITPR1-IgG/anti-Sj, covering clinical and paraclinical presentation, tumour association, serological findings, and immunopathogenesis. Methods Review of the peer-reviewed and PubMed-listed English language literature on ITPR1-IgG/anti-Sj. In addition, we provide an illustrative report on a new patient with ITPR1-IgG-associated encephalitis with cognitive decline and psychosis. Results So far, at least 31 patients with serum ITPR1-IgG/anti-Sj have been identified (clinical information available for 21). The most common manifestations were ACA, encephalopathy with seizures, myelopathy, and (radiculo)neuropathy, including autonomic neuropathy. In 45% of cases, an underlying tumour was present, making the condition a facultative paraneoplastic neurological disorder. The neurological syndrome preceded tumour diagnosis in all but one case. In most cases, immunotherapy had only moderate or no effect. The association of ITPR1-IgG/anti-Sj with manifestations other than ACA is corroborated by the case of a 48-year-old woman with high-titre ITPR1-IgG/anti-Sj antibodies and rapid cognitive decline, affecting memory, attention and executive function, and psychotic manifestations, including hallucinations, investigated here in detail. FDG-PET revealed right-temporal glucose hypermetabolism compatible with limbic encephalitis. Interestingly, ITPR1-IgG/anti-Sj mainly belonged to the IgG2 subclass in both serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in this and further patients, while it was predominantly IgG1 in other patients, including those with more severe outcome, and remained detectable over the entire course of disease. Immunotherapy with intravenous methylprednisolone, plasma exchange, and intravenous immunoglobulins, was repeatedly followed by partial or complete recovery. Long-term treatment with cyclophosphamide was paralleled by relative stabilization, although the patient noted clinical worsening at the end of each treatment cycle. Conclusions The spectrum of neurological manifestations associated with ITPR1 autoimmunity is broader than initially thought. Immunotherapy may be effective in some cases. Studies evaluating the frequency of ITPR1-IgG/anti-Sj in patients with cognitive decline and/or psychosis of unknown aetiology are warranted. Tumour screening is essential in patients presenting with ITPR1-IgG/anti-Sj.',\n",

His visual acuity was hand movement perception in the right eye, and no light perception in the left eye. The intraocular pressure, external eye examination, ocular motility and anterior segment examinations were normal. Fundus examination revealed severe bilateral papilloedema and engorged tortuous veins in both eyes. Imaging exhibited a large intracranial tumour causing raised intracranial pressure. This was debulked by neurosurgery and histological examination revealed that the tumour was an olfactory neuroblastoma (ONB).

Its immunosuppressive effects can mediate adverse events like increased risk of cancer development or appearance of opportunistic infections. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)–representing a severe opportunistic infection–has been only infrequently described during Fingolimod treatment. Here, we present a case of a 63-year-old women with pre-diagnosed RRMS who presented with new multiple cerebral lesions in a routine MRI scan, also including a tumefactive lesion in the left parietal lobe, eventually leading to the diagnosis of brain metastases derived by an adenocarcinoma of the lung. Additionally, a JCV-DNA-PCR in the cerebrospinal fluid revealed positive results, corresponding to a paraclinical progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. In conclusion, adverse events potentially associated with immunosuppression can occur during Fingolimod treatment. In this context, the occurrence of cancer and opportunistic infections should be carefully monitored. Here, we report a case in which JCV-DNA-PCR in the cerebrospinal fluid suggests asymptomatic PML and simultaneously lung cancer brain metastases developed. While it is rather unlikely that either event occurred as an adverse event of fingolimod treatment, a contributing effect cannot be formally excluded.',\n",

Case Report: We describe a 28-year old female who initially presented with headaches, behavioral changes, anxiety, lip tremors, and rigidity of extremities. She was prescribed with olanzapine and later manifested with neuroleptic malignant syndrome symptoms such as decrease in sensorium, muscle rigidity, hyperthermia and tachycardia. Further investigation showed presence of bilateral ovarian teratoma and anti-NMDAR antibodies in her serum and cerebrospinal fluid. Symptoms resolved after intravenous high-dose methylprednisolone, bilateral oophoro-cystectomy, and intravenous immunoglobulin administration. Overlapping pathological mechanisms of anti- NMDAR encephalitis and NMS were discussed. Ten patients with anti- NMDAR encephalitis and NMS were noted in a review of literature. Prognosis was favorable and intervention ranged from supportive to methylprednisolone and intravenous immunoglobulin administration, plasma exchange and teratoma resection. Conclusion: Anti- NMDAR encephalitis patients are at risk for NMS due to antipsychotic intolerance and other interrelated pathophysiological mechanisms. The overlap between the signs and symptoms of anti-NMDAR encephalitis and NMS poses a diagnostic dilemma and warrants a careful investigation and management.',\n",

This study evaluated the clinical practice and outcome of DBS for TS in a Japanese institution. This study included 25 consecutive patients with refractory TS treated with thalamic centromedian-parafascicular nucleus DBS. The severity of tics was evaluated with the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) before surgery, at 1 year after surgery, and at the last follow-up of 3 years or more after surgery. The occurrence of adverse events, active contact locations, and stimulation conditions were also evaluated. YGTSS tic severity score decreased by average 45.2% at 1 year, and by 56.6% at the last follow-up. The reduction was significant for all aspects of the scores including motor tics, phonic tics, and impairment. The mean coordinates of active contacts were 7.62 mm lateral to the midline, 3.28 mm posterior to the midcommissural point, and 3.41 mm above anterior commissure–posterior commissure plane. Efficacy and stimulation conditions were equivalent to international reports. The stimulation-induced side effects included dysarthria (32.0%) and paresthesia (12.0%). Device infection occurred in three patients (12.0%) as a surgical complication. The DBS device was removed because of infection in two patients.

He had a history of head trauma on the left side about 1 year ago, followed by neurosurgery at another hospital. Brain CT revealed a multiseptated subdural space and a mixed-density hematoma without gradation density on the contralateral side of the past head trauma region. Based on the lack of progressive neurological disturbances and the absence of gradation density in CT values inside the hematomas, his condition was judged as nonurgent, and emergency drainage was spared. One year after his first visit to our hospital, the patient experienced a normal life without any neurological disturbances, except for nocturia. The absence of gradation density in CT values along the gravity direction inside the organized hematoma may be a clue to estimate nonurgency without persistent active bleeding inside.',\n",

We review three cases of patients with PAN that illustrate a range of nervous system pathology, including the classical mononeuritis multiplex as well as uncommon brain and spinal cord vascular manifestations. Case presentation Case 1 presented with mononeuritis multiplex and characteristic skin findings. Case 2 presented with thunderclap headache and myelopathy due to spinal artery aneurysm rupture. Both patients experienced disease remission upon treatment. Case 3 presented with headache and bulbar symptoms due to partially thrombosed intracranial aneurysms, followed by systemic manifestations related to visceral aneurysms.

A better low-profile visualized intraluminal support expansion was achieved by simultaneously pushing the wire and the system within the Atlas placed at the aneurysm neck, which resulted in an increased metal coverage of the aneurysm neck and a shorter transition zone with low metal coverage at both ends of the aneurysm neck. This technique may enable a high metal coverage by low-profile visualized intraluminal support expansion without restriction by the Atlas and contribute to aneurysm occlusion by increasing the flow-diverting effect.',\n",

A recently described phenotype, linked to the p.Arg756Cys mutation, is clinically characterized by Relapsing Encephalopathy with Cerebellar Ataxia (RECA). In our case, a diagnosis of RECA has been established, and despite an alternative, reasonable cause had been already identified. We describe the case of a child with two recurrent episodes, 2 years apart, of hypotonia and ataxia. In both episodes, a laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infection suggested the diagnosis of influenza-associated encephalopathy. After the second episode, a search for genetic mutations was performed, and ATP1A3 mutation associated to RECA was found. After both episodes, the child was discharged after partial improvement of neurological conditions. The diagnosis of encephalopathy in children is often challenging. A genetic predisposition to neurological decompensation should be suspected in case of recurrent episodes, even if an alternative diagnosis has been established. Indeed, febrile infections may only represent the trigger of neurological involvement. In these patients, the knowledge of a genetic predisposing factors may help in the prevention of neurological episodes by the prompt use of anti-pyrectics and preventive measures as appropriate vaccination.',\n",

       " 'Background Since the nineteenth century, a great variety of crossed brainstem syndromes (CBS) have been described in the medical literature. A CBS typically combines ipsilateral cranial nerves deficits to contralateral long tracts involvement such as hemiparesis or hemianesthesia. Classical CBS seem in fact not to be so clear-cut entities with up to 20% of patients showing different or unnamed combinations of crossed symptoms. In terms of etiologies, acute brainstem infarction predominates but CBS secondary to hemorrhage, neoplasm, abscess, and demyelination have been described. The aim of this study was to assess the proportion of CBS caused by a bleeding episode arising from a brainstem cavernous malformation (BCM) reported in the literature. Case presentation We present the case of a typical Foville syndrome in a 65-year-old man that was caused by a pontine BCM with extralesional bleeding. Following the first bleeding episode, a conservative management was decided but the patient had eventually to be operated on soon after the second bleeding event. Discussion A literature review was conducted focusing on the five most common CBS (Benedikt, Weber, Foville, Millard-Gubler, Wallenberg) on Medline database from inception to 2020. According to the literature, hemorrhagic BCM account for approximately 7 % of CBS. Microsurgical excision may be indicated after the second bleeding episode but needs to be carefully weighted up against the risks of the surgical procedure and openly discussed with the patient. Conclusions In the setting of a CBS, neuroimaging work-up may not infrequently reveal a BCM requiring complex multidisciplinary team management including neurosurgical advice.

       " \"Background Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis is an immune-mediated disorder characterized by antibodies against the GluN1 subunit of the NMDA receptor that is increasingly recognized as a treatable cause of childhood epileptic encephalopathy. In adults, the disorder has been associated with reversible changes in brain volume over the course of treatment and recovery, but in children, little is known about its time course and associated imaging manifestations. Case presentation A previously healthy 20-month-old boy presented with first-time unprovoked seizures, dysautonomia, and dyskinesia. Paraneoplastic workup was negative, but CSF was positive for anti-NMDAR antibodies. The patient's clinical condition waxed and waned over a 14-month course of treatment with first- and second-line immunotherapies (including steroids, IVIG, rituximab, and cyclophosphamide). Serial brain MRIs scans obtained at 5 time points spanning this same period showed no abnormal signal or enhancement but were remarkable for cycles of reversible regional cortical volume loss. All scans included identical 1-mm resolution 3D T1-weighted sequences obtained on the same 3â\\x80\\x89T scanner. Using a novel longitudinal processing stream in FreeSurfer6 (Reuter M, et. al, Neuroimage 61:1402–18, 2012) we quantified the rate of change in cortical volume at each vertex (% volume change per month) between consecutive scans and correlated these changes with the time course of the patient's treatment and clinical response. We found regionally specific changes in cortical volume (up to 7% per month) that preferentially affected the frontal and occipital lobes and paralleled the patient's clinical course, with clinical decline associated with volume loss and clinical improvement associated with volume gain. Conclusions Our results suggest that reversible cortical volume loss in anti-NMDA encephalitis has a regional specificity that mirrors many of the clinical symptoms associated with the disorder and tracks the dynamics of disease severity over time. This case illustrates how quantitative morphometric techniques can be applied to clinical imaging data to reveal patterns of brain change that may provide insight into disease pathophysiology. More widespread application of this approach might reveal regional and temporal patterns specific to different types of autoimmune encephalitis, providing a tool for diagnosis and a surrogate marker for monitoring treatment response.\",\n",

Nevertheless, this functional mapping is invasive; it can be executed only during surgery and in selected patients. Moreover, the number of neuro-oncological bilingual patients is constantly growing, and performing awake surgery in this group of patients can be difficult. In this scenario, the application of accurate, repeatable and non-invasive preoperative mapping procedures is needed, in order to define the anatomical distribution of both languages.

Herein we report a case of a bilingual patient affected by brain tumor in the left temporal lobe, who underwent rnTMS mapping for both languages (Romanian and Italian), disclosing the true eloquence of the anterior part of the lesion in both tests. After surgery, language abilities were intact at follow-up in both languages.

This study aimed to report the clinical course, imaging features, and therapeutic response of MOG-IgG-associated cortical/brainstem encephalitis. Methods Data of four patients who suffered from cortical encephalitis with epileptic seizures and/or brainstem encephalitis during the course of the disease were retrospectively collected and analyzed. Results In this study, three male patients and one female patient, with a median age of onset of 21 years (ranging 20–51 years) were enrolled. An epileptic seizure was the main symptom of cortical encephalitis in these patients, while the manifestations of brainstem encephalitis were diverse. Cranial MRI demonstrated abnormal signals in unilateral or bilateral cortical or brainstem. Cerebrospinal fluid studies showed normal or mildly elevated leukocyte counts and protein levels, and a cell-based assay detected positive MOG-IgG in the serum of all patients. Two patients were misdiagnosed at the first attack, and both experienced a relapse. All of them accepted the first-line immunotherapy after a confirmed diagnosis and had a good outcome.

       " 'The purpose of the current case study was to determine the influence of an 8-week home intervention training utilizing a partial hand prosthesis on hemodynamic responses of the brain and gross dexterity in a case participant with congenital unilateral upper-limb reduction deficiency (ULD). The case participant (female, 19 years of age) performed a gross manual dexterity task (Box and Block Test) while measuring brain activity (functional near-infrared spectroscopy; fNIRS) before and after an 8-weeks home intervention training. During baseline, there was a broad cortical activation in the ipsilateral sensorimotor cortex and a non-focalized cortical activation in the contralateral hemisphere, which was non-focalized, while performing a gross manual dexterity task using a prosthesis. After the 8-week home intervention training, however, cortical activation shifted to the contralateral motor cortex while cortical activation was diminished in the ipsilateral hemisphere. Specifically, the oxygenated hemodynamics (HbO) responses increased in the medial aspects of the contralateral primary motor and somatosensory cortices. Thus, these results suggest that an 8-week prosthetic home intervention was able to strengthen contralateral connections in this young adult with congenital partial hand reduction. This was supported by the case participant showing after training an increased flexor tone, increased range of motion of the wrist, and decreased times to complete various gross dexterity tasks. Changes in HbO responses due to the home intervention training follow the mechanisms of use-dependent plasticity and further guide the use of prostheses as a rehabilitation strategy for individuals with ULD.',\n",

Introduction As the prevalence of obesity continues to rise, there is a growing need to identify practices that protect overweight patients from injury during spine surgery. Intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IONM) has been recommended for complex spine surgery, but its use in obese and morbidly obese patients is understudied. Case report This case report describes a patient with morbid obesity and ankylosing spondylitis who was treated for a T9-T10 3-column fracture with a planned, minimally invasive approach. Forty minutes after positioning the patient to prone, the IONM team identified a positive change in the patient's motor responses in the bilateral lower extremities and alerted the surgical team in a timely manner. It turned out that the pressure exerted by gravity on the patient's large pannus resulted in further dislocation of the fracture and narrowing of the spinal canal. The surgical team acknowledged the serious risk of spinal cord compression and, hence, immediately changed the surgical plan to an urgent, open approach for decompression and reduction of the fracture. The patient's lower extremities' motor responses improved after decompression. The patient was ambulatory on post-operative day 2 and pain-free at six-weeks with no other neurologic symptoms. Significance The use of IONM in this planned minimally invasive spine surgery for a patient with morbid obesity prevented potentially serious iatrogenic injury. The authors include a literature review that situates this case study in the existing literature and highlights a gap in current knowledge. There are few studies that have examined the use of IONM during spine surgery for morbidly obese patients. More research is needed to elucidate best practices for the use of IONM in spine surgery for morbidly obese patients.\",\n",

Responsive neurostimulation (RNS) is a promising therapy for pediatric patients with drug-resistant epilepsy and has been shown to be an effective therapy for reducing seizure frequency and severity in adult patients. RNS of the centromedian nucleus of the thalamus may help to prevent loss of awareness during seizure activity in PGE patients with absence seizures. Here we present a 16-year-old male, with drug-resistant PGE with absence seizures, characterized by 3 Hz spike-and-slow-wave discharges on EEG, who achieved a 75% reduction in seizure frequency following bilateral RNS of the centromedian nuclei. At 6-months post-implant, this patient reported complete resolution of the baseline daily absence seizure activity, and decrease from 3–4 generalized convulsive seizures per month to 1 per month. RNS recordings showed well-formed 3 Hz spike-wave discharges in bilateral CM nuclei, further supporting the notion that clinically relevant ictal discharges in PGE can be detected in CM.

Sensory ganglionitis, accompanied by T-cell invasion, occurs in patients with SjÃ¶gren's syndrome, resulting in sensory neuropathy of the face or limbs. Patients are assessed by quantitative sensory testing. A 76-year-old woman presented with numbness of her left face and was subsequently diagnosed with SjÃ¶gren's syndrome and primary biliary cirrhosis, and was found to have renal failure. Detection of her serum anti-Ro/SSA antibody was strongly positive. Shirmer's test or a salivary volume in the gum test also showed positive results. Her somatosensory disturbance severity was higher in the trigeminal area than in the forearm, suggesting that the trigeminal nerve is more susceptible than other parts of the nervous system in patients with SjÃ¶gren's syndrome and primary biliary cirrhosis. A simple sensory test could be performed during regular check-ups, as sensory deficits might develop after patients are diagnosed with SjÃ¶gren's syndrome and primary biliary cirrhosis.\",\n",
       " 'With recent availability of COVID-19 vaccine, post-vaccination neurological complications had been occasionally reported. Here, we reported for the first time a case of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) that developed after the first dose of inactivated virus vaccine for COVID-19. The patient developed mild fever, vomiting, diarrhea, and cough after receiving the first dose of inactivated virus vaccine. Two months later, she experienced dizziness and unsteady walking. MRI scanning of the brain revealed lesions in area postrema and bilateral hypothalamus, typical for NMOSD. Serum antibodies for AQP4, ANA, SSA, SSB, Ro-52, and p-ANCA were positive. The patient was diagnosed as AQP4-positive NMOSD with coexisting systemic autoimmunity. After treatment with methylprednisolone (500Â mg for 5Â days), symptoms were greatly relieved. As NMOSD is seriously harmful and curative, it is important to be aware of the NMOSD symptoms after vaccination. Cautions should be given for those with preexisting systemic autoimmune abnormalities in vaccination for COVID-19.',\n",

Typical symptoms are sleep disorder, gait disturbances, signs of bulbar dysfunction and a variety of neurological symptoms like oculomotor abnormalities and movement disorders. In addition, cognitive decline can be a prominent symptom. So far, there are only a few studies that have dealt with the course and possible treatment options of IgLON5 antibody encephalopathy. In this study the clinical case of a female patient with IgLON5 antibody disease and the response to treatment is described. Here we report on the case of a 67-year-old female patient who showed cognitive deterioration, gait difficulties, and chronic obstructive sleep disorder. The diagnostic course showed a positive anti-IgLON5 serum and anti-IgLON5 IgG antibodies in cerebrospinal fluid. The patient was subsequently treated with high dosage i.v. methylprednisolone, i.v. immunoglobulins and plasmapheresis. Neuropsychological tests showed cognitive deficits in different domains, including verbal and visual memory. Both, neuropsychological deficits and antibody titer, showed an improvement after plasmapheresis. The presented case shows that IgLON5 disease can present with rapidly progressing cognitive deterioration as the prominent symptom, adding to the variety of clinical signs in this disorder. Testing for IgLON5-antibodies should be considered in patients with progressing cognitive decline, especially if accompanied by sleep disorders or neurological symptoms like oculomotor abnormalities, dysautonomia or bulbar signs.',\n",

A 56-year-old man experienced massive watery discharge after hitting on his face by a falling machine. He was alert and no cerebrospinal fluid discharge on admission. Air-density was shown on the jugular fossa in the brain computed tomography. On the 3th day of trauma, he suddenly had dyspnea and loss of consciousness and became comatose. Acute edema on medulla, pons and right cerebellar hemisphere and focal infarct on right medulla were visualized on the brain magnetic resonance imaging. And the sigmoid sinus and the jugular vein were occluded and venous circulation on the right posterior fossa was diminished on the cerebral angiography. Air-density on the sinus may be an indicator into developing venous thrombosis and brainstem venous infarct could be followed by the DVST round the jugular bulb.',\n",

In general, adverse events of tacrolimus occur more often as the concentration of tacrolimus in the blood increases. We report the case of a 39-year-old man who developed a variety of adverse events despite in the therapeutic level of tacrolimus in the blood. Case presentation A 39-year-old man underwent liver transplantation for liver cirrhosis due to alcoholic liver disease. The postoperative immunosuppressant consisted of tacrolimus (5â\\x80\\x89mg) and mycophenolate (500â\\x80\\x89mg) twice daily. Five months after taking tacrolimus, he presented with talkativeness, which gradually worsened. Brain magnetic resonance imaging performed 10â\\x80\\x89months after tacrolimus administration revealed a hyperintense lesion affecting the middle of the pontine tegmentum on T2WI. The blood concentration of tacrolimus was 7.2â\\x80\\x89ng/mL (therapeutic range 5–20â\\x80\\x89ng/mL). After 21â\\x80\\x89months, he exhibited postural tremor in both the hands. Twenty-four months after taking tacrolimus, he showed drowsy mentality, intention tremor, and dysdiadochokinesia. Electroencephalography presented generalized high-voltage rhythmic delta waves; therefore, tacrolimus was discontinued in suspicion of tacrolimus-induced neurotoxicity, and anticonvulsive treatment was started. The level of consciousness gradually improved, and the patient was able to walk independently with mild ataxia. Conclusion This case shows that tacrolimus-induced neurotoxicity can occur even at normal concentrations. Therefore, if a patient taking tacrolimus exhibits psychiatric or neurologic symptoms, neurotoxicity should be considered even when the blood tacrolimus is within the therapeutic range.',\n",

Neuroimaging findings on MRI are fairly nonspecific and classically include periventricular white matter signal abnormalities and diffuse atrophy. Focal parenchymal lesions may demonstrate post contrast ring or nodular enhancement and calcification. However, the MR imaging characteristics can be highly variable. Here, we present two cases of HLH in infants with multiple hemorrhagic lesions mostly depicted in both thalami and basal ganglia regions. Thalamic, basal ganglia, and brain stem involvement with hemorrhagic changes in HLH are rarely described in literature. Early diagnosis of HLH may be lifesaving.

Patients with SjÃ¶gren's syndrome commonly present with dry eyes (xerophthalmia) and dry mouth (xerostomia). However, the clinical manifestations of SjÃ¶gren's syndrome can be complicated and variable due to involvement of extraglandular organ systems, such as the nervous system. The neurological manifestations of this disorder often precede those of other exocrine gland symptoms. Hence, early diagnosis of SjÃ¶gren's syndrome remains a challenge. Case presentation We report the case of a 63-year-old woman with primary SjÃ¶gren's syndrome who presented with acute motor and sensory axonal neuropathy (AMSAN). Treatment with glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants partially improved her muscle weakness and paresthesia. Conclusions This case demonstrates the importance of early recognition and diagnosis of AMSAN in association with primary SjÃ¶gren's syndrome to achieve a favorable clinical outcome. Primary SjÃ¶gren's syndrome may be underdiagnosed because of vague symptoms of the sicca complex. Comprehensive immunological testing to evaluate this condition may be performed in patients presenting with variants of Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome.\",\n",

A 48-year-old male patient presented with acute mental deterioration, severe headache, and weakness of both legs. The patient's previous medical history included cerebral metastases from ALK-positive lung adenocarcinoma, which had been successfully managed via whole brain radiation therapy and gamma knife radiosurgery one year and three months before, respectively. Physical examination revealed neck stiffness and paraparesis with motor grade I. Gadolinium-enhanced brain MRI showed newly developed leptomeningeal enhancement along cerebellar folia, and whole spine MRI revealed similar leptomeningeal metastasis along the whole spinal axis. Lorlatinib was started orally with a dose of 100 mg/day. The patient showed rapid clinical improvement after one week. The patient was alert and the headache disappeared, while the paraparesis improved to normal ambulatory status. Two months of lorlatinib treatment resulted in almost complete disappearance of previous leptomeningeal enhancement of brain and spinal cord, and absence of newly developed metastatic lesions in the central nervous system, based on MRI results. The patient had been regularly followed with ongoing lorlatinib therapy for 5 months without any systemic complications or neurological abnormality. Conclusively, lorlatinib could be a rapid and effective treatment for patients with central nervous system leptomeningeal metastases arising from ALK-positive lung cancer.\",\n",

This letter is the first report of the spectrum of neurological disorders observed in patients with severe COVID-19 from a resource limited setting like India. Till October 30 th Neurologic complications in severe COVID-19 in Pune, India Of the 423 patients with severe COVID-19, 20 (4.7%) had pre-existing neurologic co-morbidities, with cerebrovascular disease (8 patients) being the most common. Poliomyelitis (4 patients) was also an important co-morbidity associated with severe COVID-19. Bodyache or myalgia (207/423, 49 %) and headache (59/423, 13.9 %) were the most common neurologic symptoms observed in patients. Encephalopathy (22/423, 5.2 %) and new onset large vessel ischemic stroke secondary to cerebral artery thrombosis (5/423, 1.1%) were the most common secondary neurologic complications noted in our cohort.

A 70-year-old female patient presented with numbness in the left side of face, arm, and leg. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a lesion with intense gadolinium (Gd)-enhancement in the ventral portion of the midbrain. A stereotactic biopsy demonstrated mixed T-cell and B-cell infiltrating inflammatory lesions without demyelination. Three months after postoperative treatment with steroid, the lesion markedly decreased on follow-up MRI. Twenty-six months after the initial attack, she complained of dysarthria and urinary incontinence. Repetitive MRI showed a lesion with homogeneous enhancement, extensively involving the bilateral cerebral hemisphere, corpus callosum, and the right middle cerebellar peduncle. The confirmed diagnosis was diffuse large B-cell lymphoma on the second biopsy. Despite our best efforts, she died 38 months after disease onset. Based on review of the literature and our case, preceding inflammatory lesions are not always demyelinating and T-cell dominant inflammatory lesions. When the initial biopsy reveals an inflammatory lesion in an old-aged patient, the clinician should keep in mind the development of PCNSL and perform close clinical and radiological observations for a timely diagnosis.',\n",

Pathologically, it is characterized by eosinophilic hyaline intranuclear inclusions in the cells of the visceral organs as well as central, peripheral, and autonomic nervous system cells. Recently, a GGC repeat expansion in the NOTCH2NLC Case presentation A 60-year-old Taiwanese woman reported a four-month history of progressive weakness beginning in the right foot that spread to all four extremities. She was diagnosed with ALS because she met the revised El Escorial diagnostic criteria for definite ALS with upper and lower motor neuron involvement in the cervical, thoracic, and lumbosacral regions. She died of respiratory failure at 22Â months from ALS onset, at the age of 62Â years. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed lesions in the medial part of the cerebellar hemisphere, right beside the vermis (paravermal lesions). The subclinical neuropathy, indicated by a nerve conduction study (NCS), prompted a potential diagnosis of NIID. Antemortem skin biopsy and autopsy confirmed the coexistence of pathology consistent with both ALS and NIID. We observed neither eccentric distribution of p62-positive intranuclear inclusions in the areas with abundant large motor neurons nor cytopathological coexistence of ALS and NIID pathology in motor neurons. This finding suggested that ALS and NIID developed independently in this patient. Conclusions We describe a case of concurrent NIID and ALS discovered during an autopsy. Abnormal brain MRI findings, including paravermal lesions, could indicate the coexistence of NIID even in patients with ALS showing characteristic clinical phenotypes.',\n",

Since patients affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection present coagulation and immune system dysregulation, ischemic or haemorragic stroke is not uncommon, irrespective of respiratory distress. However, the occurrence of focal neurological deficits together with other symptoms like headache, cortical blindness, seizure and altered mental status should prompt the diagnosis of Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES). Antithrombotic treatment, the alteration of endothelial function, and coagulopathy due to COVID-19 and PRES leading to the breakdown of blood–brain barrier may then contribute to the occurrence of a brain haemorrhage. Methods We describe the case of a COVID-19 patient who developed bilateral occipital lobe haemorrhages suggestive of haemorrhagic PRES. We then reviewed the available literature about haemorrhagic evolution of PRES in COVID-19. Results We describe the clinical and radiological features of five COVID-19 patients who developed haemorrhagic PRES. Conclusions Coagulopathy and endothelial dysfunction resulting from the massive release of cytokines during the host immune response may be key factors in the pathogenesis of COVID-19-related PRES. Antithrombotic therapy and the leakage of the blood–brain barrier can subsequently increase the risk of haemorrhagic transformation of the lesioned brain tissue. A prompt diagnosis of PRES is mandatory, since the timely interruption/reversal of antithrombotic therapy may be a key determinant for a good prognosis.',\n",

GAD-related TLE has poor response to anti-seizure medications and immune therapies, and epilepsy surgery is rarely successful. We report on a 47-year-old female with history of migraine, autoimmune thyroid disease, ankylosing spondylitis, and drug-resistant TLE. A video electroencephalography recorded frequent seizures with temporo-insular semiology, correlating to left temporal epileptiform activity and left mesiotemporal hyperintensity on magnetic resonance imaging. GAD autoimmunity was confirmed by very high GAD antibody titers in serum and cerebrospinal fluid. Steroids, immunoglobulins, and cyclophosphamide had no effect, and selective left amygdalectomy was performed based on very restricted hypermetabolism on positron-emission tomography. After transient seizure freedom, significant epilepsy improvement was observed in spite of memory decline. Transient worsening was noted 1 year later during diabetes mellitus manifestation and 5 years later during presentation of progressive CA, which stabilized on rituximab treatment. We believe this case illustrates the diversity and the frequent overlap of GAD-associated disorders, the need of early and aggressive immunotherapy in severe patients, as well as the possible benefit from epilepsy surgery in some GAD-TLE.',\n",

       " \"Summary. The purpose of this work was to study the changes in the cerebral microcirculation parameters in the development of secondary cerebral ischemia. Methods: A total of 202 TBI patients were recruited, within 6h after injury with a GCS less 12. All patients were subjected to perfusion computed tomography. The cerebral blood flow velocity was recorded using transcranial Doppler. Arterial blood pressure was measured noninvasively. The levels of cerebrovascular resistance (CVR), cerebral arterial compliance (CAC), cerebrovascular time constant (CTC) and critical closing pressure (CCP) were measured using the neuromonitoring complex. All patients were unilateral foci of post-traumatic ischemia. Statistical analysis was performed using the paired Student's t-test and factor analysis. Results and Conclusions: CVR and CCP were significantly increased whereas CAC and CTC were significantly decreased in SCI development at TBI (p <0.05). Factor analyses also revealed that CVR, CAC and CTC were significantly associated with the development of posttraumatic ischemia (p <0.05). The changes of CVR and CCP in patients with TBI were statistically significantly associated (p <0.05) with the secondary ischemia development\",\n",

A 53-year-old woman presented with weakness and paresthesia in her right arm and leg. Upon admission, brain MRI showed about 10 multiple brain tumors, which had to be differentiated from multiple brain metastases, lymphoma, and high-grade glioma in both hemispheres. No primary cancer was found in the chest-abdomen-pelvis CT. Subsequent spine MRI revealed multifocal cord signal change involving C2–T7, suggesting myelitis. A decrease in visual acuity was noted when taking a medical history, and optic neuritis was diagnosed upon ophthalmologic examination. With clinical and radiological appearances, multiple brain and spinal cord lesions have been diagnosed as NMOSD. Steroid and immunosuppressive drugs were administered.

There is neither a specific cure, nor a standard treatment for Fahr's syndrome and treatment is primarily symptomatic. Brain imaging has gained widespread use in order to support clinicians in diagnosing intracranial calcifications. Case Presentation We present a case of an 83-year-old female patient who presented with symptoms of confusion, fever, nausea, and vomiting. Clinical diagnosis of Fahr's syndrome secondary to hypopathyroidism was based on the neuropsychiatric signs and symptoms, laboratory evidence of hypoparathyroidism, and radiological signs of calcifications in the basal ganglia. The patient improved following replacement therapy with calcium gluconate, followed by oral supplemental calcitriol.

While some have argued for the existence of recurrent GBS, most classify the syndrome as a form of relapsing-remitting CIDP. However, there are cases of GBS with treatment-related fluctuations that must be distinguished from A-CIDP as patients with A-CIDP require long-term immunotherapy. In this case report, we discuss a patient with multiple relapses over 3 years, who is more likely to have A-CIDP.

       " 'ABSTRACT Two cases of optic neuropathy due to superficial siderosis (SS) are reported in two patients, aged 29 and 38 years, operated for intracranial neoplasms, the first one with a desmoplasic infantile ganglioglioma excised in 1991, and the other one with a pilocytic astrocytoma, operated on in 1997, 1998 and 2016. Both patients presented with progressive loss of visual acuity, as a result of bilateral optic nerve atrophy, as well as unsteadiness, ataxic gait and hearing loss. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and spine, including gradient echo (GRE) T2-weighted acquisitions, revealed thin optic nerves and strong hypointensity with susceptibility artefacts corresponding to haemosiderin deposits within the meningeal layers of the spine, the infra- and supratentorial spaces of the brain and the peri-optic sheaths in both patients. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was macroscopically haemorrhagic in one patient, who underwent a dynamic myelography, which failed to reveal any trans-dural CSF leakage. Neuro-ophthalmological symptoms due to SS, such as visual acuity loss, have been scarcely reported. MRI using GRE T2-weighted sequences highlighting the presence of haemosiderin deposits plays a key role in the diagnosis of this condition. Treatment should aim at preventing haemosiderin deposition by treating the cause of the subarachnoid bleeding.',\n",

Here, we describe a case of paraneoplastic collapsing response-mediator protein-5 (CRMP5)-associated transverse myelitis (TM) where plasma neurofilament light (NfL) chain and glial fibrillary protein (GFAP) levels were observed over a 14-month clinical course, correlating with radiographical and clinical outcome measures in response to treatment. Blood and CSF samples obtained at diagnosis as well as 7 and 14 months into treatment. At the time of initial diagnosis, both plasma NfL (782.62 pg/ml) and GFAP (283.26 pg/ml) were significantly elevated. Initial treatment was with IV steroids and plasma exchange (PLEX) followed by neuroendocrine tumor removal, chemotherapy, and radiation. After initial improvement with chemotherapy, the patient experienced clinical worsening and transient elevation of plasma NfL (103.27 pg/ml and GFAP (211.58 pg/ml) levels. Whole body positron emission tomography PET scan did not demonstrate recurrence of malignancy. Repeat PLEX and rituximab induction resulted in improvements in patient function, neurologic exam, and plasma biomarker levels. To our knowledge, this is the first described longitudinal, prospective analysis of neuronal injury biomarkers and association of clinical treatment outcomes in CRMP5 myelitis. Our findings suggest that clinical improvement correlates with NfL and GFAP concentrations.',\n",

Differentiating these diseases are difficult because of the similarity in their clinical and radiological features. It is unclear that skin biopsy can distinguish NIID from FXTAS. We performed a skin biopsy in an FXTAS case with cognitive dysfunction and peripheral neuropathy without tremor, which was initially suspected to be NIID. Case presentation The patient underwent neurological assessment and examinations, including laboratory tests, electrophysiologic test, imaging, skin biopsy, and genetic test. A brain MRI showed hyperintensity lesions along the corticomedullary junction on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in addition to middle cerebellar peduncle sign (MCP sign). We suspected NIID from the clinical picture and the radiological findings, and performed a skin biopsy. The skin biopsy specimen showed ubiquitin- and p62-positive intranuclear inclusions, suggesting NIID.

It is often difficult for the patient to reconcile with their post-injury persona, and the memory of pre-injury personhood is particularly painful. Insight into one's cognitive deficits subsequent to injury can lead to an existential crisis and a sense of loss, including loss of self. Objective Restoration of cognitive functions and reconciliation with loss of pre-traumatic personhood employing a holistic method of neuropsychological rehabilitation in a patient suffering from TBI. Methods Ms. K.S, a 25-year-old female, presented with emotional disturbances following TBI. She reported both retrograde and anterograde amnesia. A multidimensional holistic rehabilitation was planned. Treatment addressed cognitive deficits through the basic functions approach. Cognitive behavioural methods for emotional regulation like diary writing helped reduce irritability and anger outbursts. Use of social media created new modes of memory activation and interactions. Compensatory strategies were used to recover lost skills, music-based attention training helped foster an individualised approach to the sense of one's body and self. Results As a result of these differing strategies, changes were reflected in neuro-psychological tests, depression score and the patient's self-evaluation. This helped generate a coherent self-narrative. Conclusion Treatment challenges in such cases are increased due to patient's actual deficits caused by neuronal/biochemical changes. Innovative and multi-pronged rehabilitation strategies which involve everyday activities provided an answer to some of these problems. This method of rehabilitation may provide an optimistic context for future research.\",\n",

       " \"Parkinson's disease is often complicated by psychiatric symptoms. Psychiatrists are caught in a dilemma between such symptoms and physical treatment since Parkinson's disease sometimes shows treatment resistance based on pharmacological treatment-induced dopamine dysfunction. Here, we report on a 64-year-old woman with a 15-year history of Parkinson's disease with stage IV severity based on the Hoehn and Yahr scale. She was admitted to our hospital with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder with psychotic features. Unfortunately, her treatment course for depression was complicated by neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Because we were concerned about the persistence of her depressive symptoms, the risk of psychotropic drugs causing adverse effects, and progressive disuse syndrome, we administered modified electroconvulsive therapy. Her symptoms of neuroleptic malignant syndrome and depression sufficiently improved after five sessions of modified electroconvulsive therapy. Additionally, the primary motor symptoms of her Parkinson's disease also markedly improved. The improvement of neuroleptic malignant syndrome and her motor symptoms based on dopamine dysfunction can be explained by electroconvulsive therapy's effectiveness in activating dopamine neurotransmission. Besides, the marked improvement of her depressive episode with psychotic features was presumed to involve dopamine receptor activation and regulation. Because advanced Parkinson's disease can sometimes be refractory to treatment based on pharmacological treatment-induced dopamine dysfunction, psychiatrists often have difficulty treating psychiatric symptoms; electroconvulsive therapy may stabilize the dopaminergic system in such cases, presenting a possible non-pharmacologic treatment option for Parkinson's disease.\",\n",

The cortico-caudate-thalamic circuit involving the pre-Supplementary Motor Area (pre-SMA) has been proposed to underlie verbal retrieval functions. We hypothesized that High Definition-transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (HD-tDCS) targeting the pre-SMA would selectively modulate this circuit to remediate verbal retrieval deficits. After the patient underwent 10 sessions of 20 min of 1 mA HD-tDCS targeting the pre-SMA, we documented significant improvements for verbal fluency and naming, and for working memory and executive function tasks that involve the frontal lobes. The effects persisted for up to 14 weeks after completion of HD-tDCS treatment. We also demonstrated normalization of the event-related potentials suggesting modulation of the underlying neural circuit.

However, the increase of those therapies is associated with novel toxicities, mainly immune-related adverse events (irAEs), never observed before. Different irAEs are now well characterized, and, among them, neuromuscular complications, following immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICPi) therapy, are increasingly studied and described. However, there are also neurological complications related to the use of other targeted therapies, less known and probably underestimated. Herein we describe two oncological patients who developed neuromuscular diseases after administration of targeted therapies, different from ICPi. Case reports The first patient was treated with the combination of Vemurafenib and Cobimetinib, BRAF and MEK inhibitors, respectively, for a cutaneous melanoma. One year after the beginning of the combined treatment, she developed a sub-acute motor neuropathy with predominant cranial nerve involvement. She was successfully treated with methylprednisolone. The second patient received therapy with Imatinib, tyrosine kinase inhibitor and precursor of the targeted therapy, for a gastrointestinal stromal tumour. Few days after the first administration, he developed generalized myasthenia gravis with respiratory failure. Clinical remission was obtained with plasma-exchange, intravenous immunoglobulins and steroids. Discussion andÂ Conclusion We strengthen the relevance of neuromuscular complications which may occur long after treatment start or in patients receiving not only the latest ICPi but also \"older\" and apparently better-known targeted therapies. Also in the latter cases, an immune-mediated \"off-target\" pathogenic mechanism can be hypothesized, and consequences can be life threatening, if not promptly diagnosed and appropriately managed.',\n",

This is a patient with a history of rare inherited immune dysregulation that presented to the electrodiagnostic laboratory with severe neuropathic pain in the right foot associated with plantarflexion weakness, concerning for a tibial mononeuropathy. However, the patient's clinical presentation and results on electrodiagnostic testing were not consistent with any of the above entities. Therefore, noncompressive etiologies of tibial mononeuropathies such as vasculitis had to be considered. The patient subsequently underwent sural nerve biopsy which confirmed small-vessel vasculitis as the cause of the tibial mononeuropathy. She was then started on appropriate immunosuppressive treatment which resulted in significant pain relief and was discharged home. This case highlights the importance of considering noncompressive causes of tibial nerve injury. Compressive and vasculitic tibial mononeuropathies along with their electrodiagnostic considerations are reviewed. Furthermore, this case highlights the critical role of the electromyographer and ability to maximize the impact on patient care through a solid foundation in anatomy, pathophysiology, and electrodiagnosis blended with clinical acumen.\",\n",

We report a patient with secondary NL caused by germinal center B-cell (GCB)-type diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who showed selective infiltration of the lumbar plexus to the spinal cord and massive nerve enlargement resulting in severe pain. Case presentation A 72-year-old female exhibited asymmetric motor and sensory impairments and pain in the lower limbs that progressed for five months. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an enlarged lumbar plexus, which continued to the cauda equina via the L3 and L4 spinal nerves. Her symptoms gradually worsened. Ten months after the onset of symptoms, the enlarged cauda equina filled the spinal canal space, and the spinal cord was swollen. A cauda equina biopsy was performed, and she was diagnosed with GCB-type DLBCL with CD10 positivity. The primary tumor was found in a mammary cyst. The autopsy study did not show apparent infiltration, except in the nervous system. Conclusions Although there are many neurologic phenotypes of malignant lymphoma, the association between the cytological characteristics of lymphoma and the neurological phenotypes is still unclear. Several reports of CD10-positive secondary NL are available, whereas peripheral or central nervous tissue origin lymphoma cases are mostly negative for CD10. CD10 staining may be useful for distinguishing primary NL from secondary NL. NL often has a strong organotropism for peripheral nervous tissue, which makes early diagnosis challenging.

Onconeural antibodies, including Hu, Yo, Ri, anti-CV2, amphiphysin, Ma2, and Tr are well-characterized and commonly used for the diagnosis of definite PNS. Generally, anti-CV2 antibodies have usually been associated with cerebellar ataxia, chorea, peripheral and autonomic neuropathies, myelopathy, optic neuritis, and retinitis. However, Parkinsonism has not been reported as the core symptom in patients with anti-CV2 antibodies. Case presentation We report a patient with anti-CV2 antibody manifested as Parkinsonism and autonomic dysfunction, which may lead to the diagnosis of multiple system atrophy with predominant Parkinsonism (MSA-P).

In this study, a 25-year-old woman with NF1 and left optic radiation (OR) glioma underwent surgery to remove the glioma. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) revealed a Pilocytic Astrocytoma (PA) WHO grade I. Post-operation chemotherapy done using nine treatment cycles of administering Temozolomide (TMZ) for 5 days every 4 weeks. Applying the region of interest (ROI) differential tractography method and SWAP four times every 3 months allowed us to follow the patient's visual acuity alterations longitudinally. The differential deterministic tractography method and statistical analyses enabled us to discover the white matter (WM) tracts anisotropy alterations over time. Furthermore, statistical analyses on the SWAP results along time illustrated possible alterations in visual acuity. Then, we could compare and associate the findings with the SWAP examinations and patient symptoms longitudinally. Statistical analyses of SWAP tests revealed a significant improvement in visual fields, and longitudinal differential tractography showed myelination and dense axonal packing in the left OR after 1 year of treatment. In this study, we examined an old hypothesis suggesting that chemotherapy is more effective than radiotherapy for NF1 patients with OP gliomas (OPGs) because of the radiation side effects on the visual field, cognition, and cerebrovascular complications. Our longitudinal clinical case study involving dMRI and SWAP on a single NF1-OPG patient showed that chemotherapy did not suppress the OP myelination over time. However, it should be noted that this is a clinical case study, and, therefore, the generalization of results is limited. Future investigations might focus on genetic-based imaging, particularly in more cases. Further, meta-analyses are recommended for giving a proper Field Of View (FOV) to researchers as a subtle clue regarding precision medicine.\",\n",

Methods: We describe 2 cases of patients with methamphetamine use disorder who were diagnosed with severe tetanus and our experience in the use of rocuronium to control their spasms. We performed a systematic review of the SCOPUS and PubMed databases for case reports and case series describing the use of rocuronium in tetanus patients who also have methamphetamine use disorder. We discussed the clinical features and treatment outcomes. Results: A total of 4 cases of patients with substance abuse disorder who had severe tetanus were reported in the literature, including the current cases. The mean age was 28.8 years; all of them male. Trismus, generalized limb and abdominal rigidity were the most common presentation. Three patients underwent emergency tracheostomy. Rocuronium was given as 0.008mg/kg bolus in 1 patient; 2 patients received an intravenous bolus dose of 0.6mg/kg. Infusion dose ranged from 5 to 10 mcg/kg/min.

       " 'The neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 are wide-ranging from simple headache to severe demyelinating brain disease. This is a review of collected case reports of patients with SARS-CoV-2 with neurological manifestations presenting to the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS). Neurological manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2 such as encephalitis, acute cerebrovascular disease, encephalitis with chorea, post-COVID myositis and Guillain-BarrÃ© Syndrome (GBS) are of great concern but are often overlooked in the presence of life-threatening abnormal vital signs in severely ill SARS-CoV-2 patients. There is a need to diagnose these manifestations at the earliest opportunity to limit long-term consequences and complications. Much research is needed to explore the role of SARS-CoV-2 in causing these neurological manifestations by isolating it either from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or the brain tissue of the deceased on autopsy. We also recommend exploring the risk factors that lead to the development of these neurological manifestations.',\n",
       " 'A BSTRACT Non-functioning pituitary macroadenomas are often detected after a long latency period, with symptoms due to compression of adjacent structures (headache, visual field abnormality) and hyposecretion of pituitary hormones. Irrespective of endocrinal disturbances, these patients sometimes demonstrate mood abnormalities, cognitive deterioration, and psychotic symptoms, in such cases usually other symptoms prevail in the clinical picture. Only rare anecdotal case reports are available in which isolated neuropsychiatric or cognitive symptoms were the presenting features of pituitary adenomas. We report a 17-year-old boy with non-functioning pituitary macroadenoma, who presented with depressive symptoms for 6 months, along with predominantly mood-congruent psychotic features and anterograde memory impairment. On subsequent evaluation, he was found to have subclinical abnormalities in visual field testing. His endocrinological and other ancillary investigations were normal. He partially responded to multiple antidepressants and is currently being planned for surgical intervention. Hence, clinicians need to perform neuroimaging in cases with depressive symptoms, when the course is atypical, unsatisfactory response to multiple antidepressants, prominent psychotic/memory-related symptoms to rule out secondary causes. In such cases, pituitary adenomas should also be considered as one of the clinical differentials.',\n",
       " 'Although penetrating brain injury is rare, it is associated with high morbidity and mortality. In several studies, even if very few patients arrive at the hospital alive, half of them eventually die, and the other half have significant neurological sequelae. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage caused by traumatic brain injury is common. Therefore, we should be aware of the complications, prognosis, and follow-up strategies of penetrating brain injuries. A 55-year-old man was brought to our hospital with diffuse cerebral contusion and skull fracture. Three weeks after successful surgery, the patient returned with a large amount of pneumocephalus and pneumoventricle caused by delayed CSF leakage. Fortunately, the patient was discharged without neurological deficits after reoperation. In the urgent situation of penetrating brain injury, the treatment and prognosis vary depending on the initial actions and clinical factors. In addition, we should be aware that a variety of complications, as well as CSF leakage, can occur in patients with penetrating brain injuries.',\n",

Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is an emerging form of brain stimulation used to improve sensorimotor impairments in many neurological disorders. Here, we describe a combined therapeutic approach with botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT-A) and tDCS for the treatment of upper limb tremor in a patient with MS. We administered a cathodal tDCS 15 days after the injections of BoNT-A. Both post-injection and post-stimulation evaluation revealed a considerable improvement of the tremor.

       " 'Music-supported therapy (MST) follows the best practice principles of stroke rehabilitation and has been proven to instigate meaningful enhancements in motor recovery post-stroke. The existing literature has established that the efficacy and specificity of MST relies on the reinforcement of auditory-motor functional connectivity in related brain networks. However, to date, no study has attempted to evaluate the underlying cortical network nodes that are key to the efficacy of MST post-stroke. In this case series, we evaluated changes in connectivity within the auditory-motor network and changes in upper extremity function following a 3-week intensive piano training in two stroke survivors presenting different levels of motor impairment. Connectivity was assessed pre- and post-training in the Î±- and the Î²-bands within the auditory-motor network using magnetoencephalography while participants were passively listening to a standardized melody. Changes in manual dexterity, grip strength, movement coordination, and use of the upper extremity were also documented in both stroke survivors. After training, an increase in the clinical measures was accompanied by enhancements in connectivity between the auditory and motor network nodes for both the Î±- and the Î²-bands, especially in the affected hemisphere. These neurophysiological changes associated with the positive effects of post-stroke MST on motor outcomes delineate a path for a larger scale clinical trial.',\n",

We report a 44-year-old untreated HIV positive Congolese woman who presented with two episodes of vision loss associated with pain in first her left eye and then her right eye and was diagnosed with a relapsing optic neuropathy. A correlation was observed between the clinical activity and cerebrospinal fluid viral load, CD4-count in the blood and magnetic resonance imaging signs of blood – optic nerve barrier breakdown. CD4 cell counts and viral loads are great clinical features to identify the type of acute optic neuropathy since differential diagnosis between an infectious optic neuropathy or an auto-immune induced optic neuropathy such as neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder or immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome can be puzzling.',\n",

Findings In this case series of 3 pediatric patients with subacute neuropsychiatric impairment, 2 had intrathecal anti–SARS-CoV-2 antibodies as well as intrathecal antineural antibodies. Anti–transcription factor 4 (TCF4) autoantibodies in one patient who responded to immunotherapy were validated. Meaning A subset of pediatric patients with COVID-19 and subacute neuropsychiatric symptoms have intrathecal antineural autoantibodies, suggesting central nervous system autoimmunity in pediatric patients with COVID-19 and recent neuropsychiatric symptoms. This case series examines whether anti–SARS-CoV-2 and autoreactive antibodies are present in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of pediatric patients with COVID-19 and subacute neuropsychiatric dysfunction. Importance Neuropsychiatric manifestations of COVID-19 have been reported in the pediatric population. Objective To determine whether anti–SARS-CoV-2 and autoreactive antibodies are present in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of pediatric patients with COVID-19 and subacute neuropsychiatric dysfunction. Design, Setting, and Participants This case series includes 3 patients with recent SARS-CoV-2 infection as confirmed by reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction or IgG serology with recent exposure history who were hospitalized at the University of California, San Francisco Benioff Children's Hospital and for whom a neurology consultation was requested over a 5-month period in 2020. During this period, 18 total children were hospitalized and tested positive for acute SARS-CoV-2 infection by reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction or rapid antigen test. Main Outcomes and Measures Detection and characterization of CSF anti–SARS-CoV-2 IgG and antineural antibodies. Results Of 3 included teenaged patients, 2 patients had intrathecal anti–SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. CSF IgG from these 2 patients also indicated antineural autoantibodies on anatomic immunostaining. Autoantibodies targeting transcription factor 4 (TCF4) in 1 patient who appeared to have a robust response to immunotherapy were also validated. Conclusions and Relevance Pediatric patients with COVID-19 and prominent subacute neuropsychiatric symptoms, ranging from severe anxiety to delusional psychosis, may have anti–SARS-CoV-2 and antineural antibodies in their CSF and may respond to immunotherapy.\",\n",
       " 'Patients with drug-resistant focal onset epilepsy are not always suitable candidates for resective surgery, a definitive intervention to control their seizures. The alternative surgical treatment for these patients in Japan has been vagus nerve stimulation (VNS). Besides VNS, epileptologists in the United States can choose a novel palliative option called responsive neurostimulation (RNS), a closed-loop neuromodulation system approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2013. The RNS System continuously monitors neural electroencephalography (EEG) activity at the possible seizure onset zone (SOZ) where electrodes are placed and responds with electrical stimulation when a pre-defined epileptic activity is detected. The controlled clinical trials in the United States have demonstrated long-term utility and safety of the RNS System. Seizure reduction rates have continued to improve over time, reaching 75% over 9 years of treatment. The incidence of implant-site infection, the most frequent device-related adverse event, is similar to those of other neuromodulation devices. The RNS System has shown favorable efficacy for both mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and neocortical epilepsy of the eloquent cortex. Another unique advantage of the RNS System is its ability to provide chronic monitoring of ambulatory electrocorticography (ECoG). Valuable information obtained from ECoG monitoring provides a better understanding of the state of epilepsy in each patient and improves clinical management. This article reviews the developmental history, structure, and clinical utility of the RNS System, and discusses its indications as a novel palliative option for drug-resistant epilepsy.',\n",

Anti-adaptor protein 3, subunit B2 (AP3B2) autoantibodies have thus far been associated with diseases affecting the cerebellum or vestibulocerebellum. Through this case report, we aim to broaden the spectrum of anti-AP3B2-associated disease. Case description: We report on a 51-year-old woman with a brain injury approximately 28 years ago who recently underwent neuropsychological testing, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain (cMRI), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. Neural autoantibodies were determined in serum and CSF. Our patient suffered from mild cognitive impairment (amnestic MCI, multiple domains) with stable memory deficits and a decline in verbal fluency and processing speed within a two-year interval after the first presentation in our memory clinic. Brain MRI showed brain damage in the right temporoparietal, frontolateral region and thalamus, as well as in the left posterior border of the capsula interna and white matter in the frontal region. Since the brain damage, she suffered paresis of the upper extremities on the left side and lower extremities on the right side as well as gait disturbance. Our search for autoantibodies revealed anti-AP3B2 autoantibodies in serum. Conclusions: Our report expands the spectrum of symptoms to mild cognitive impairment in addition to a gait disturbance associated with anti-AP3B2 autoantibodies. Furthermore, it is conceivable that a prior traumatic brain injury could initiate the development of anti-AP3B2-antibody-associated brain autoimmunity, reported here for the first time.',\n",

Part of this lesion and the meninges showed gadolinium enhancement. Physical examination revealed the presence of a tumor in the right breast, which was later diagnosed as invasive ductal carcinoma. In addition, laboratory examinations led to the detection of anti-AQP-4 antibodies in her serum; consequently, the patient was diagnosed as having NMOSD. She received initial pulsed steroid therapy, followed by right mastectomy.

       " \"Introduction: This paper describes a case of bi-frontal vasogenic oedema associated with bilateral frontal lobe and left parietal lobe white matter lesions where extensive investigations, including brain biopsy, failed to establish a diagnosis. Case Report: A 67-year-old female presented with three weeks' history of memory loss, fatigue, insomnia, nausea, and occasional dysphasia. Physical examination was unremarkable, yet cerebral CT and MRI showed bilateral frontal lobe vasogenic oedema. Extensive investigations, including: biochemical; radiological; immunological; microbiological; haematological; histopathological; and cytological, failed to establish a confirmed diagnosis. A multidisciplinary team could not achieve a consensus for this atypical presentation. Brain biopsy was unusual, showing destructive inflammatory and subtly granulomatous disease, but an exhaustive list of auxiliary tests could not confirm a cause, and consensus favoured glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) autoimmune encephalopathy. Discussion: A definitive diagnosis could not be established for this patient despite a gamut of investigations. Although some of the presenting features were consistent with GFAP astrocytopathy, initial staining of the patient's CSF for neuronal antibodies was negative. Her symptoms and radiological changes of brain imaging improved without any corticosteroid therapy. Conclusions: Through this case report, the aim is to add to the repository of neurological sciences in the hope that future similar presentations could potentially lead to discovery of a new aetiology or contribute towards better understanding of an existing disease process.\",\n",
       " \"Tremor of the upper extremity is a significant cause of disability in some patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). The MS tremor is complex because it contains an ataxic intentional tremor component due to the involvement of the cerebellum and cerebellar outflow pathways by MS plaques, which makes the MS tremor, in general, less responsive to medications or deep brain stimulation (DBS) than those associated with essential tremor or Parkinson's disease. The cerebellar component has been thought to be the main reason for making DBS less effective, although it is not clear whether it is due to the lack of suppression of the ataxic tremor by DBS or else. The goal of this study was to clarify the effect of DBS on cerebellar tremor compared to non-cerebellar tremor in a patient with MS. By wearing an accelerometer on the index finger of each hand, we were able to quantitatively characterize kinetic tremor by frequency and amplitude, with cerebellar ataxia component on one hand and that without cerebellar component on the other hand, at the beginning and end of the hand movement approaching a target at DBS Off and On status. We found that cerebellar tremor surprisingly had as good a response to DBS as the tremor without a cerebellar component, but the function control on cerebellar tremor was not as good due to its distal oscillation, which made the amplitude of tremor increasingly greater as it approached the target. This explains why cerebellar tremor or MS tremor with cerebellar component has a poor functional transformation even with a good percentage of tremor control. This case study provides a better understanding of the effect of DBS on cerebellar tremor and MS tremor by using a wearable device, which could help future studies improve patient selection and outcome prediction for DBS treatment of this disabling tremor.\",\n",

       " 'Long lasting symptoms have been reported in a considerable proportion of patients after a severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. This condition, defined as either \"post-acute coronavirus disease (COVID),\" \"long COVID,\" or \"long-haul COVID,\" has also been described in outpatients and in individuals who are asymptomatic during the acute infection. A possible overlap exists between this condition and the functional neurological disorders (FNDs). We report a 23-year-old man who developed, after asymptomatic COVID-19, a complex symptomatology characterized by fatigue, episodic shortness of breath, nocturnal tachycardia, and chest pain. He also complained of attention and memory difficulties, fluctuating limb dysesthesia, and weakness of his left arm. After neurological examination, a diagnosis of FND was made. Notably, the patient was also evaluated at a post-COVID center and received a diagnosis of long COVID-19 syndrome. After 4 months of psychoanalytic psychotherapy and targeted physical therapy in our center for FNDs, dysesthesia and motor symptoms had resolved, and the subjective cognitive complaints had improved significantly. However, the patient had not fully recovered as mild symptoms persisted limiting physical activities. Long-term post COVID symptoms and FNDs may share underlying biological mechanisms, such as stress and inflammation. Our case suggests that functional symptoms may coexist with the long COVID symptoms and may improve with targeted interventions. In patients presenting with new fluctuating symptoms after SARS-CoV-2 infection, the diagnosis of FNDs should be considered, and the positive clinical signs should be carefully investigated.',\n",

       " 'Circadian and other physiological rhythms play a key role in both normal homeostasis and disease processes. Such is the case of circadian and infradian seizure patterns observed in epilepsy. However, these rhythms are not fully exploited in the design of active implantable medical devices. In this paper we explore a new implantable stimulator that implements chronotherapy as a feedforward input to supplement both open-loop and closed-loop methods. This integrated algorithm allows for stimulation to be adjusted to the ultradian, circadian and infradian patterns observed in patients through slowly-varying temporal adjustments of stimulation and algorithm sub-components, while also enabling adaption of stimulation based on immediate physiological needs such as a breakthrough seizure or change of posture. Embedded physiological sensors in the stimulator can be used to refine the baseline stimulation circadian pattern as a \"digital zeitgeber,\" i.e., a source of stimulus that entrains or synchronizes the subject\\'s natural rhythms. This algorithmic approach is tested on a canine with severe drug-resistant idiopathic generalized epilepsy exhibiting a characteristic diurnal pattern correlated with sleep-wake cycles. Prior to implantation, the canine\\'s cluster seizures evolved to status epilepticus (SE) and required emergency pharmacological intervention. The cranially-mounted system was fully-implanted bilaterally into the centromedian nucleus of the thalamus. Using combinations of time-based modulation, thalamocortical rhythm-specific tuning of frequency parameters as well as fast-adaptive modes based on activity, the canine experienced no further SE events post-implant as of the time of writing (7 months). Importantly, no significant cluster seizures have been observed either, allowing the reduction of rescue medication. The use of digitally-enabled chronotherapy as a feedforward signal to augment adaptive neurostimulators could prove a useful algorithmic method in conditions where sensitivity to temporal patterns are characteristics of the disease state, providing a novel mechanism for tailoring a more patient-specific therapy approach.',\n",

Case presentation We discuss a 51-year-old man who presented with asymmetric subacute sensorimotor deficits in the lower limbs. Initial clinical examination showed weakness throughout the right lower limb and normal strength on the left with objective numbness in a mixed dermatomal and stocking-glove distribution. Electrophysiology was consistent with axonal sensorimotor neuropathy. Cerebrospinal fluid showed pleocytosis and elevated protein. Intravenous immunoglobulin treatment was given with some improvement in pain symptoms but no measurable motor improvement. Following clinical and electrophysiologic deterioration the patient was transferred to a tertiary centre. Magnetic resonance imaging of the spine showed smooth enhancement of the ventral caudal nerve roots. Chest computed tomography revealed left lower vascular scarring. Further positron emission tomography scan imaging identified fluorodeoxyglucose avid right lung lymphadenopathy. Bronchoscopy-guided biopsy revealed small cell lung carcinoma. Onconeural and antiganglioside antibodies were negative. The patient was then transferred to a medical oncology ward where he underwent chemoradiotherapy and subsequently experienced improvement in his motor function, supporting that his neurological condition was indeed secondary to a paraneoplastic process. Conclusions Onconeural negative paraneoplastic radiculoneuropathy can precede diagnosis of small cell lung carcinoma. If considered early and adequately investigated, it can allow earlier diagnosis and treatment of underlying malignancy, improving overall and neurological prognosis.',\n",

Unfortunately, the patient became unwell and died at 21â\\x80\\x89months after initial diagnosis. This demonstrates a need for continued research and reporting on this uncommon disease entity.\",\n",
       " 'Myasthenia gravis is a neuromuscular autoimmune disease that results in skeletal muscle weakness that worsens after periods of activity and improves after rest. Myasthenia gravis means \"grave (serious), muscle weakness.\" Although not completely curable, it can be managed well with a relatively high quality of life and expectancy. In myasthenia gravis, antibodies against the acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction interfere with regular muscular contraction. Although most commonly caused by antibodies to the acetylcholine receptor, antibodies against MuSK (muscle-specific kinase) protein can also weaken transmission at the neuromuscular junction. Muscle-specific tyrosine kinase myasthenia gravis (MuSK-Ab MG) is a rare subtype of myasthenia gravis with distinct pathogenesis and unique clinical features. Diagnosis can be challenging due to its atypical presentation as compared to seropositive myasthenia gravis. It responds inconsistently to steroids, but plasma exchange and immunosuppressive therapies have shown promising results. We report a case of a 49-year-old female who presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure. Our patient experienced progressive, undiagnosed MuSK-Ab MG for years without a diagnosis.',\n",
       " 'Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a potentially fatal diagnosis composed of hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and autonomic instability. This syndrome has significant systemic complications including acute renal failure, rhabdomyolysis, hyperkalemia, and seizure. It is associated with the use of both typical and atypical antipsychotics. Due to the extensive neurodegenerative destruction of dopaminergic and acetylcholinergic pathways, patients with Lewy body dementia (LBD) are particularly sensitive to antidopaminergic and anticholinergic medications, making them more susceptible to extrapyramidal side effects and NMS. We present a case of a 72-year-old female with LBD who developed muscular rigidity, vital sign instability, and altered mental status after receiving one dose of paliperidone palmitate injection two weeks prior to admission. Initial blood work was unrevealing. Extensive workup including EEG, lumbar puncture with cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and brain MRI was unremarkable. She was treated with seven days of bromocriptine and a lorazepam taper with improvement in muscle rigidity. However, her mental status never improved, and she remained comatose. She was later intubated for airway protection after an aspiration event that led to hypoxia. Her respiratory status never recovered, and she was transitioned to comfort care. This case demonstrates the complexity and potential fatality of NMS. Clinicians should be aware of this dangerous complication of antipsychotic use in patients with LBD as these patients may be more susceptible to this complication.',\n",

       " 'Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a neuropsychiatric pathology characterized by dysfunctions in the frontal lobe of the brain, especially in planning, execution, and inhibition tasks, with an inability to make decisions and handle different sequences, also affecting the temporal lobe. The patient presents alterations to store, consolidate, and recall information. These neurocognitive deficits are accompanied by neurobehavioral disorders such as depression, anxiety, and apathy that contribute to the worsening of the quality of life, with a high impact on the individual, social, and family level. To identify the neurobehavioral disorders and neurocognitive deterioration that present a patient diagnosed with FTD: clinical case of low incidence and prevalence disease in Colombia. A 40-year-old man, with progressive deterioration of his immediate verbal memory, low verbal fluency, aberrant motor behavior, sexual impulsivity, alterations in his executive functions, especially in planning tasks, decision-making, and inhibition was found to have a lesser degree of affectation in his visuospatial functioning and visuoconstructive abilities. It was found that the patient presents a severe dysexecutive syndrome associated with a clinical picture of FTD, correlated with an inability to process and recall information, accompanied by disorders such as depression, anxiety, and apathy. It is necessary to generate a functional neurorehabilitation plan that aims to improve the quality of life in these patients. In the same way, it is necessary to create new lines of research and intervention that have the purpose to create a greater field of heuristics or new questions in this type of neurodegenerative pathologies.',\n",

When the symptoms concern something else, they almost exclusively affect living beings. Neuropsychological and neuropsychiatric studies, as well as functional neuroanatomy studies, have led to hypothesize possible relationships among cognitive-neurofunctional alterations and symptoms of depersonalization and derealization. The present study suggests that a malfunction of the left frontal and prefrontal cortex causes deficits of working memory, producing some of the symptoms of DD.',\n",
       " 'Background and Objectives To describe the marked clinical and biological responses of a targeted treatment with anti–interleukin-6 (IL-6)–receptor antibody and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors in a patient with a severe, corticoresistant CNS toxicity of immune-checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy. Methods A 58-year-old man was admitted for subacute paraparesis, urinary retention, and ascending paresthesia. He was under treatment with ipilimumab and nivolumab for metastatic melanoma. Spine MRI disclosed multiple T2-hyperintense, contrast-enhancing longitudinally extensive lesions. A diagnosis of ICI-related acute transverse myelitis was made. Results ICIs were immediately discontinued, and the patient received high-dose glucocorticoids plus 1 session of plasma exchange, but he did not improve. Based on the marked elevation of CSF IL-6 (505 pg/mL), a second-line targeted therapy with anti-IL-6-receptor tocilizumab (8 mg/kg/mo for 3 infusions) plus JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib (50 mg/d) was administered. Patient neurologic status started to improve shortly after, with corresponding radiologic resolution. At 9 months, the patient was able to walk independently, presenting only slight residual disability while remaining in oncologic partial response. Discussion Our case suggests that some patients with severe, corticoresistant CNS immune-related toxicities of ICIs may benefit from cytokine blockade. Cytokine measurement in serum and CSF might help in selecting patients for personalized treatment strategies.',\n",

CT/MR imaging showed a common pattern of multifocal subcortical/cortical petechial-type hemorrhages, while SWI showed more extensive multifocal abnormalities. The appearances are consistent with a thrombotic microangiopathy and may be due to the heightened level of thrombosis in patients with COVID-19.',\n",

       " 'Background Anterior spinal cord herniation (aSCH) is a rare cause of myelopathy which may present as pure motor syndrome and mimic other degenerative diseases of the spinal cord. In slowly progressive cases, diagnosis may be impeded by equivocal imaging results and mistaken for evolving upper motor neuron disease. As early imaging studies are lacking, we aimed to provide a detailed description of imaging and neurophysiology findings in a patient with aSCH, focusing on the early symptomatic stages. Case presentation We here present the case of a 51-year old male patient with an episode of pain in the right trunk and a normal spinal MRI. After a symptom-free interval of 8â\\x80\\x89years, spasticity and paresis evolved in the right leg. There was subtle ventral displacement and posterior indentation of the thoracic spinal cord on MRI which, in retrospect, was missed as an early sign of aSCH. After another 3â\\x80\\x89years, symptoms spread to the left leg and a sensory deficit of the trunk became evident. Follow-up MRI now clearly showed an aSCH. Neurosurgical intervention consisted of remobilization of the herniated spinal cord and patch closure of the dura defect. Over the following years, motor and sensory symptoms partially improved. Conclusions The history of this patient with aSCH illustrates the importance of careful longitudinal clinical follow-up with repeated imaging studies in progressive upper motor neuron syndromes. Specific attention should be paid to a history of truncal pain and to MRI findings of a ventrally displaced spinal cord. Neurosurgical intervention may halt the progression of herniation.',\n",
       " \"Automatic anatomical segmentation of patients' anatomical structures and modeling of the volume of tissue activated (VTA) can potentially facilitate trajectory planning and post-operative programming in deep brain stimulation (DBS). We demonstrate an approach to evaluate the accuracy of such software for the ventral intermediate nucleus (VIM) using directional leads. In an essential tremor patient with asymmetrical brain anatomy, lead placement was adjusted according to the suggested segmentation made by the software (Brainlab). Postoperatively, we used directionality to assess lead placement using side effect testing (internal capsule and sensory thalamus). Clinical effects were then compared to the patient-specific visualization and VTA simulation in the GUIDEâ\\x84¢ XT software (Boston Scientific). The patient's asymmetrical anatomy was correctly recognized by the software and matched the clinical results. VTA models matched best for dysarthria (6 out of 6 cases) and sensory hand side effects (5/6), but least for facial side effects (1/6). Best concordance was observed for the modeled current anterior and back spread of the VTA, worst for the current side spread. Automatic anatomical segmentation and VTA models can be valuable tools for DBS planning and programming. Directional DBS leads allow detailed postoperative assessment of the concordance of such image-based simulation and visualization with clinical effects.\",\n",
       " \"ABSTRACT Recurrent painful ophthalmoplegic neuropathy (RPON) replaced the term 'ophthalmoplegic migraine' as the condition behaves more like an inflammatory cranial neuropathy than a primary headache disorder. RPON may be associated with cranial nerve thickening on MR imaging and persistent oculomotor paresis. Oculomotor tumours have rarely been described in cases of relapsing painful ophthalmoplegia with and without persistent paresis. Here, we present a case of relapsing painful left ophthalmoplegia that gradually became persistent. MR imaging after 14 years of symptoms revealed an enhancing tumour of the left oculomotor nerve. It is unclear whether the tumour was the cause of the attacks or whether repeated cycles could lead to tumour development. MR imaging is indicated in patients with RPON who develop persistent deficits to screen for associated oculomotor tumour.\",\n",

       " 'The efficacy of deep brain stimulation (DBS) for refractory Tourette syndrome (TS) is accepted, but whether the efficacy of DBS treatment in the Japanese population is equivalent to those reported internationally and whether adverse effects are comparable are not yet known. This study evaluated the clinical practice and outcome of DBS for TS in a Japanese institution. This study included 25 consecutive patients with refractory TS treated with thalamic centromedian-parafascicular nucleus DBS. The severity of tics was evaluated with the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) before surgery, at 1 year after surgery, and at the last follow-up of 3 years or more after surgery. The occurrence of adverse events, active contact locations, and stimulation conditions were also evaluated. YGTSS tic severity score decreased by average 45.2% at 1 year, and by 56.6% at the last follow-up. The reduction was significant for all aspects of the scores including motor tics, phonic tics, and impairment. The mean coordinates of active contacts were 7.62 mm lateral to the midline, 3.28 mm posterior to the midcommissural point, and 3.41 mm above anterior commissure–posterior commissure plane. Efficacy and stimulation conditions were equivalent to international reports. The stimulation-induced side effects included dysarthria (32.0%) and paresthesia (12.0%). Device infection occurred in three patients (12.0%) as a surgical complication. The DBS device was removed because of infection in two patients. DBS is an effective treatment for refractory TS, although careful indication is necessary because of the surgical risks and unknown long-term outcome.',\n",

Neuroimaging in GCA may reveal optic nerve sheath enhancement, which is a cardinal finding of optic perineuritis (OPN). The clinical manifestations of GCA can mimic that of other ocular disorders including amiodarone-associated optic neuropathy (AAON). We report a case of biopsy-proven GCA in a patient initially suspected to have AAON. This patient presented with bilateral optic disc oedema in conjunction with subacute predominately monocular vision loss and enhancement of the corresponding optic nerve sheath on neuroimaging. Clinicians should recognise that clinical and neuroimaging findings of GCA can mimic a variety of ocular and orbital pathologies including idiopathic OPN and AAON.',\n",
       " 'Hemichorea–hemiballism (HC–HB) is a spectrum of involuntary flinging and flailing, non-patterned, irregular movements involving one side of the body. A rare dysfunction of glucose metabolism leading to a state of non-ketotic hyperglycemia (NKH) is thought to be a cause of these symptoms. In previous case studies, imaging findings have been in the basal ganglia as hyperintense lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or hyperdensities on computerized tomography (CT). This case is unique due to abnormal findings in the MRI T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence in areas not previously reported—the thalamus and midbrain/pons. As in other NKH cases, the patient improved both clinically and radiologically. In patients with uncontrolled diabetes and abnormal movements, monitoring of blood glucose is imperative as it can lead to recognition of HC–HB. Other etiologies, including stroke, neoplasm, demyelination, and inflammatory processes, have uncertain prognoses with unfavorable outcomes. The prognosis for NKH is usually favorable, and thus important to identify.',\n",

The presence of cognitive and behavioral comorbidities and the relation with the location of mutations has been scarcely investigated in Becker. This case report describes the neurocognitive and behavioral profiles of 3 brothers with Becker carrying an in-frame deletion of exons 45-48. The 3 cases underwent 2 consecutive neuropsychological assessments of which one assessment took place when they completed their primary education (age range of the cases: 11.2 -12.1 years). Intellectual abilities were normal to high and all cases had difficulties with processing speed and math. The brothers differed in intellectual abilities, executive functions, working memory, attention and reading abilities. Variability in cognitive development was noted as well. This report suggests that cognitive and behavioral functions in Becker vary regardless of gene mutation and exposer to similar environmental factors.',\n",

There are few comprehensive descriptions of audiovestibular function in iSS and therefore limited understanding of the affected segment(s) of the audiovestibular pathway. In addition, monitoring disease progression and response to treatment is challenging and currently mainly guided by subjective patient reports and magnetic resonance imaging. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no previous reports assessing central auditory function in iSS. We describe such findings in a patient with iSS in an attempt to precisely localize the site of the audiovestibular dysfunction, determine its severity and functional impact. We confirm the presence of (asymmetrical) auditory neuropathy and identify central auditory processing deficits, suggesting involvement of the central auditory pathway beyond the brainstem. We correlate the audiological and vestibular findings with self-report measures and the siderosis appearances on brain magnetic resonance images.',\n",
       " 'Paraneoplastic autoimmune neurological disorders reflect tumor-initiated immune responses against onconeural antigens. Symptoms and signs can affect the central and/or peripheral nervous systems, neuromuscular junction or muscle, and typically evolve subacutely before an underlying neoplasm is discovered. We describe four patients whose neurological symptoms were precipitated by potent innate immune system challenges: bladder instillation of BCG, tick bite and an \"alternative cancer therapy\" with bacterial extracts and TNF-Î±. We hypothesize that a tumor-initiated autoimmune response (evidenced by autoantibody profiles), pre-dating the immune system challenge, was unmasked or amplified in these patients by cytokines released systemically from innate immune cells activated by microbial pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). The resultant upregulation of cognate onconeural peptides as MHC1 protein complexes on neural cell surfaces would render those cells susceptible to killing by CD8+ T cells, thus precipitating the patient\\'s neurological symptoms.',\n",

MRI demonstrated extensive thickening and enhancement of multiple cranial nerves and peripheral nerve plexuses with corresponding elevated metabolism on FDG PET/CT. Treatment with chemotherapy resulted in complete response on FDG PET/CT and subsequently she underwent autologous stem cell transplantation. NL is a rare manifestation of lymphoma affecting the peripheral nervous system. Nonspecific neuropathic symptoms make clinical diagnosis difficult.

A 49-year-old lady was diagnosed in 2004 with a left temporal lobe lesion as an incidental finding; she was followed up clinically and radiologically. In 2016, the lesion showed contrast enhancement and she was offered surgical resection but given she is asymptomatic, she refused. In 2018, the lesion showed signs of transformation with ring contrast enhancement, increased vasogenic oedema and perfusion; the patient accepted surgery at that point. She had preoperative mapping by navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation and she had operative resection with 5-ALA. The tumour was bright fluorescent under Blue 400 filter—Zeiss Pentero 900Â©(Carl Zeiss Meditec)—and both bright fluorescence and pale fluorescence were resected. Postoperative MRI showed complete resection and histopathology revealed WHO grade I papillary glioneuronal tumour, negative for BRAF V600 mutation.

In this article, we present a case of 25-year-old man with a transverse myelitis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and spine showed several, periventricular, infratentorial, and spinal cord white matter lesions. He was diagnosed with MS and was started on fingolimod, which did not result in any improvement. Follow-up brain and spine MRI showed a longitudinally extensive lesion with leptomeningeal enhancement. Leptomeningeal and cerebellar biopsy showed non-necrotizing granulomas consistent with neurosarcoidosis. Fingolimod was discontinued.

She was initially diagnosed with Guillain–BarrÃ© syndrome (GBS) based on her clinical presentation and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showing albuminocytological dissociation. However, she was later found to have anti-neuronal nuclear antibody 1 (ANNA-1/anti-Hu)-positive CSF and was subsequently diagnosed with small-cell lung cancer. Her neurological symptoms were ultimately attributed to ANNA-1/anti-Hu-associated paraneoplastic polyneuropathy. During the course of her evaluation, she had magnetic resonance imaging findings of dorsal predominant cauda equina nerve root enhancement, which has not been previously described. The only previously reported case of cauda equina enhancement due to ANNA-1-associated polyneuropathy described ventral predominant findings. The distinction between ventral and dorsal enhancement is important, since it suggests that different patterns of nerve root involvement may be associated with this paraneoplastic syndrome. Therefore, ANNA-1-associated paraneoplastic inflammatory polyneuropathy can be considered in the differential diagnosis of cauda equina nerve root enhancement with ventral and/or dorsal predominance. This can potentially be helpful in differentiating ANNA-1 polyneuropathy from GBS, which classically has ventral predominant enhancement.',\n",

Given the nature and extent of the damage, cognitive and functional deficits are typically chronic even after standard therapies. Here, we describe a novel treatment approach that used high definition transcranial direct-current stimulation (HD-tDCS) with a 62-year-old male who was 5 years post-anoxic leukoencephalopathy secondary to an accidental drug overdose. HD-tDCS was administered over the left lateral prefrontal cortex across 29 daily sessions at 2 mA (20 minutes/session) in order to address dysexecutive behaviors. Results demonstrated improved delayed memory and trends for improved visuospatial and semantic fluency performance as well as improved insight and daily functioning, all of which returned to baseline by the end of a 10 week no-contact follow up period. Resting state fMRI connectivity results mirrored these changes by showing increased dorsal attention and cingulo-opercular but reduced ventral attention network connectivity after session 29, all of which returned to baseline at follow-up. These findings suggest HD-tDCS may benefit functioning even following serious and pervasive anoxic injury. Findings also suggest the need for continued HD-tDCS for maintenance purposes, though future work is needed to identify optimal dose-response information.',\n",

This paper was motivated by a neuroscience experiment using EEG signals as the outcome of our established interventional protocol, a new method in neurorehabilitation toward developing a treatment for visual verticality disorder in post-stroke patients. To analyze the [complex outcome measure (EEG)] that reflects neural-network functioning and processing in more specific ways regarding traditional analyses, we make a comparison among sparse time series models (classic VAR, GLASSO, TSCGM, and TSCGM-modified with non-linear and iterative optimizations) combined with a graphical approach, such as a Dynamic Chain Graph Model (DCGM). These dynamic graphical models were useful in assessing the role of estimating the brain network structure and describing its causal relationship. In addition, the class of DCGM was able to visualize and compare experimental conditions and brain frequency domains [using finite impulse response (FIR) filter]. Moreover, using multilayer networks, the results corroborate with the susceptibility of sparse dynamic models, bypassing the false positives problem in estimation algorithms. We conclude that applying sparse dynamic models to EEG data may be useful for describing intervention-relocated changes in brain connectivity.',\n",

       " \"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurodegenerative condition whose manifestation and clinical evolution can present themselves in very different ways. Analogously, its treatment has to be personalized and the patient's response may be idiosyncratic. At this moment there is no cure for it, in addition to its clinical course sometimes being torpid, with a poor response to any treatment. However, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) has demonstrated its usefulness as a non-invasive therapeutic tool for the treatment of some psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases. Some studies show that the application of rTMS implies improvement in patients with MS at various levels, but the effects at the psychometric level and the redox profile in blood have never been studied before, despite the fact that both aspects have been related to the severity of MS and its evolution. Here we present the case of a woman diagnosed with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) at the age of 33, with a rapid progression of her illness and a poor response to different treatments previously prescribed for 9 years. In view of the patient's clinical course, a compassionate treatment with rTMS for 1 year was proposed. Starting from the fourth month of treatment, when reviewing the status of her disease, the patient denoted a clear improvement at different levels. There followed out psychometric evaluations and blood analyses, that showed both an improvement in her neuropsychological functions and a reduction in oxidative stress in plasma, in correspondence with therTMS treatment.\",\n",

Our patient was eventually found to carry the same myotilin c.179C>T p.Ser60Phe mutation. Muscle MRI was helpful in delineating clinically unsuspected involvement of paraspinal and pelvi-femoral muscles, as well as showing marked myopathic fatty infiltration of distal leg muscles. The association of neuropathy and myopathy is a recognized feature of myofibrillar myopathy. In some patients with unexplained foot drop, whole-body muscle MRI and a dedicated genetic mutation testing strategy may help reveal a diagnosis of genetic myopathy.\",\n",

Although there are no widely accepted treatments for TBI, new investigational approaches, such as photobiomodulation (PBM), are being tested. PBM is a light therapy that uses red to near-infrared (NIR) light to stimulate, heal, and protect tissue that has been injured or is at risk of dying. Benefits following transcranial PBM treatments in animal models of acute TBI and a small number of chronic TBI patients have been reported. However, the human PBM TBI studies published to date have been based on behavioral assessments. This report describes changes in behavioral and neuroimaging measures after 8 weeks of PBM treatments. The subject was a 23-year professional hockey player with a history of concussions, presumed to have caused his symptoms of headaches, mild anxiety, and difficulty concentrating.

Objective In this study, we present the first 12 cases of the use of intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IONM) during therapeutic epiduroscopy in patients with clinical canal stenosis. Methods IESS was performed using two working instruments: an epidural balloon to dilate the epidural space without damaging the nerve structures (ResaloonÂ®) and an element to perform flavotomy of the ligamentum flavum (ResaflexÂ®). The procedure was performed at levels of the greatest stenosis, as detected using preoperative magnetic resonance imaging. Results Of the 12 cases that used IONM, 2 patients presented neurotonic activity in roots during ligamentum flavum ablation, 1 patient presented neurotonic activity while using ResaloonÂ® in a root contralateral to the level at which the procedure was conducted, and other presented neurotonic activity in a root below the level at which the ligamentum flavum was ablated. In all cases, potentially harmful discharges stopped when the procedure was interrupted momentarily. Conclusions Intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring detected alterations in surgical field and roots below and/or contralateral to the field, which disappeared with complete recovery after interrupting the procedure; this can avoid the possible prolonged or even permanent complications postoperatively. Significance Intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring during epiduroscopy is safe, thus optimizing surgical outcomes.',\n",

Case presentation A 53-year-old female patient suffered head trauma resulting from a backward fall. While bathing at a public bathhouse, she fell backward and struck the occipital area of her head against the floor. After the head trauma, she experienced pain in the abdomen and in both hands and feet. She underwent evaluations including conventional brain MRI, abdominal and pelvic ultrasonography, and stomach and intestine endoscopy. No abnormality was observed in her brain or abdomen. In addition, her abdominal pain had not been relieved by medical management. When she came to our hospital 4 years after the head trauma, her pain characteristics and severity were as follows: intermittent pain without allodynia or hyperalgesia; squeezing and warm creeping-like pain in the abdomen (visual analog scale score: 7); tingling pain in both hands and feet (visual analog scale score: 7). She was prescribed pregabalin and gabapentin, and her abdominal and limb pain was well-controlled at a tolerable level. On DTT 4 years after head trauma, the upper portion of the spinothalamic tracts (STTs) in both hemispheres showed partial tearing. Discussion and conclusions Injury of the STT was demonstrated by using DTT in a patient who showed abdominal pain that was refractory to medical management following mild TBI. Our results suggest that central pain due to STT injury might be suspected in patients with abdominal pain that is refractory to medical management following TBI.',\n",

Furthermore, some subtypes of XP, including XPA, may manifest themselves with quite severe neurological symptoms in addition to the characteristic dermatological lesions. Accordingly, the aim of the current study is to highlight the predominant neurological aspects of XPA, as well as mild-to-moderate dermatological signs in a Hungarian family with 5 affected siblings. Case reports The symptoms of the Caucasian male proband started to develop at 13–14Â years of age with predominantly cerebellar, hippocampal, and brainstem alterations. His elder sister and three younger brothers all presented similar, but less expressed neurological signs. The diagnostic work-up, including clinical exome sequencing, revealed 2 novel compound heterozygous mutations (p.Gln146_Tyr148delinsHis, p.Arg258TyrfsTer5) in the XPA Conclusions In summary, we present the first family with genetically confirmed XPA in the Central-Eastern region of Europe, clearly supporting the notion that disturbed function of the C-terminal region of the XPA protein contributes to the development of age-dependent neurologically predominant signs.

The most common subtype of MB in the dorsal brainstem is the Wingless (WNT) subtype that contains activating mutations in the WNT pathway effector CTNNB1. Ipsilateral cerebellar hemi-atrophy with a brainstem tumour is a finding that is usually documented with brainstem gangliogliomas as a possible specific imaging sign. We present a case of a 23-year-old female with progressive headache, imbalance on walking, double vision and difficulty in swallowing for a year. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a mass with prominent restricted diffusion on the dorsal surface of the lower brainstem with ipsilateral cerebellar atrophy. The final histopathological diagnosis was a Sonic Hedgehog (SHH)-activated and TP53 wild-type primary lower dorsal brainstem MB. Primary SHH-activated TP53 wild-type dorsal brainstem MB is extremely rare, and as far as we know, the association of the tumour with ipsilateral cerebellar hemi-atrophy in an adult has never been reported.

We identified neurocognitive impairment and neuropsychiatric symptoms in a patient diagnosed with CBD. Participant was a 70-year-old female patient, single; she presented progressive memory loss of an immediate verbal nature. Initially, she was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and Lewy body dementia, finding that she had no characteristic signs and symptoms of these pathologies. The patient presented conciliation insomnia, gait disturbances, and severe neurocognitive deficit, especially in executive functions, immediate verbal memory, and visuospatial functioning. It was found that the patient presented neurocognitive alterations of the executive type (frontal lobe) such as decision making, planning, inhibition and operative memory, correlated with a severe alteration in her basic, instrumental and advanced activities of daily life, with a high risk factor for developing dementia. It is necessary to diagnose in an assertive and timely manner in order to generate functional neurorehabilitation plans in people diagnosed with CBD, with the main objective of positively impacting quality of life, at the individual, family, and social level.\",\n",

Clinical patterns of phantom pain, phantom sensation, and pump pain may overlap and these symptoms may also exist in one patient. Serious trauma to the upper limbs can result in brachial plexus avulsion (BPA). If BPA occurs at the same time as severe trauma of the upper extremity and the amputation of the upper limb is performed, chronic neuralgia caused by BPA may be mistaken for chronic amputation pain, such as phantom limb pain or stump pain. No major treatment advances in phantom pain have been made. However, unlike phantom limb pain, chronic neuropathic pain caused by BPA can be effectively treated with dorsal root entry zone lesioning (DREZ)-otomy. We report a patient who suffered for 34 years because the neuralgia caused by BPA was accompanied by an amputation of the arm, and so was thought to be amputation stump pain rather than BPA pain.

It is also dangerous because of the risk of occlusion of the normal vessels around the lesion. Inducing temporary cardiac arrest using adenosine may be helpful in limiting and minimizing these risks. However anaesthetic management of this procedure in children suffering from high-flow vascular lesions is difficult and challenging. Methods We report three paediatric patients with high-flow cerebrospinal vascular lesions that underwent endovascular treatment under general anaesthesia and temporary cardiac arrest with adenosine. Adenosine was administered in escalating doses to induce a few seconds of cardiac standstill and the onyx injection was synchronized with the onset of adenosine-induced cardiac standstill, the fistula being occluded by onyx. Results There were no complications in peri-procedural treatment in all three cases. Post-embolization angiography revealed complete obliteration of the lesion, and the patients' neurological status progressively improved at follow-up.

Methods The medical history and clinical evaluation were completed by electrophysiological tests: sensory and motor nerve conduction studies, needle electromyography, motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) after transcranial magnetic stimulation, patellar T (tendon) responses, quadriceps and soleus H (Hoffman) reflex recordings. Results In the two patients, history, clinical evaluation, nerve conduction studies, favorable response to intravenous immunoglobulins, and positive anti-GM1 antibodies fulfilled the diagnosis of MMN. The lower limbs were asymptomatic, except for a unilateral weakness of foot dorsiflexion. The patellar and Achilles tendon reflexes disappeared during the course of the disease. The sensory nerve conduction studies were normal or minimally modified, M-wave and MEP/M amplitude ratio to the quadriceps were normal, patellar T (tendon) responses were virtually absent, and H-reflex to the quadriceps and soleus muscles were absent.

In various neuropsychiatric disorders, the coordination of cortical activity may be decreased or enhanced as a result of neurobiological compensatory mechanisms. Methods. In this paper, we analyzed the EEG signals in resting-state condition, with reference to three patients with a similar set of psychopathological symptoms typical for the first psychotic episode, but with different functional and structural neural basis of the disease. Additionally, those patients were compared with a demographically matched healthy individual. We used the non-linear method of time series analysis based on the recurrences of states, to verify whether functional connectivity configurations assessed with recurrence method will qualitatively distinguish patients from a healthy subject, but also differentiate patients from each other. Results. Obtained results confirmed that the connectivity architecture mapped with the recurrence analysis substantially differentiated all participants from each other. An applied analysis additionally showed the specificity of cortical desynchronization and over-synchronization matched to the psychiatric or neurological basis of the disease. Despite this encouraging finding, group-oriented studies are needed to corroborate our qualitative results, based only on a series of clinical case studies.',\n",

       " 'Brain abscesses are a rare complication of dental procedures. High concentrations of ammonia in brain abscesses may increase vasogenic edema and other brain abscess symptoms. Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (OTCD) is an x-linked genetic disorder of the urea cycle associated with an increased risk of brain damage due to hyperammonia. During acute metabolic decompensations, due to stresses such as infection in OTCD patients, blood ammonia levels become moderately high. This, in turn, causes cerebral glutamine levels to increase and exacerbate cerebral edema and neurological symptoms. In this report, we present a 25-year-old woman with known partial OTCD who presented with bilateral brain abscesses 2 weeks after a wisdom tooth extraction. Neurotoxic effects of ammonia, from local ammonia formation in brain abscesses positive for streptococcus intermedius, or due to her OTCD, may have exacerbated the cerebral edema, which resulted in irreversible encephalopathy that lead to her death.',\n",
       " 'Introduction CNS cavernomas are a type of raspberry-shaped vascular malformations that are typically asymptomatic, but can result in haemorrhage, neurological injury, and seizures. Here, we present a rare case of a brainstem cavernoma that was surgically resected whereafter an upbeat nystagmus presented postoperatively. Case report A 42-year old man presented with sudden-onset nausea, vomiting, vertigo, blurred vision, marked imbalance and difficulty swallowing. Neurological evaluation showed bilateral ataxia, generalized hyperreflexia with left-sided predominance, predominantly horizontal gaze evoked nystagmus on right and left gaze, slight left labial asymmetry, uvula deviation to the right, and tongue deviation to the left. MRI demonstrated a 13-mm cavernoma with haemorrhage and oedema in the medulla oblongata. Surgery was performed via a minimal-invasive, midline approach. Complete excision was confirmed on postoperative MRI. The patient recovered well and became almost neurologically intact. However, he complained of mainly vertical oscillopsia. The videonystagmography revealed a new-onset spontaneous upbeat nystagmus in all gaze directions, not suppressed by fixation. An injury of the rarely described intercalatus nucleus/nucleus of Roller is thought to be the cause. Conclusion Upbeat nystagmus can be related to several lesions of the brainstem, including the medial longitudinal fasciculus, the pons, and the dorsal medulla. To our knowledge, this is the first case of an iatrogenic lesion of the nucleus intercalatus/nucleus of Roller resulting in an upbeat vertical nystagmus. For neurologists, it is important to be aware of the function of this nucleus for assessment of clinical manifestations due to lesions within this region.

The etiologic characterization is crucial to define the treatment and prognosis in secondary vasculitis. The purpose of this study is to describe the pathway of etiologic investigation including the role of nerve biopsy. Methods Retrospective analysis of patients seen in the neuromuscular outpatient clinic during the last four years with peripheral neuropathy in the context of systemic vasculitis or other autoimmune diseases. Results We present five patients with stepwise progressive sensorimotor deficits of upper and lower limbs. All patients presented with systemic features and one of them had an established diagnosis of systemic vasculitis. They underwent an extended blood panel, including autoimmune and serologic tests. Electromyography and nerve conduction studies revealed asymmetric axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathies in four patients, and an axonal sensorimotor multiple mononeuropathy in one. Four patients underwent nerve biopsy and the other performed a skin biopsy, with findings suggestive of possible vasculitic processes. The etiologies identified included microscopic polyangiitis, HBV-related polyarteritis nodosa and two eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. In the last patient a specific etiology could not be established. Conclusion This series reveals the etiologic and phenotypic diversity of peripheral neuropathies related with systemic vasculitis.

       " 'Intradural spinal arteriovenous fistulas (sAVF) are spinal vascular lesions that usually manifest due to myelopathy or local symptoms caused by venous congestion and ischemia. In addition, perimedullary arteriovenous fistulas (PMAVF) in particular may rupture and cause subarachnoid or intramedullary hemorrhage along with relevant symptoms. Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) can propagate into cranial space with clinically dominant symptoms and signs of typical aneurysmal intracranial SAH. The standard workup for cerebral SAH, after excluding an intracranial source of hemorrhage, is usually limited to a cervical spine MRI; therefore, thoracolumbar sources of hemorrhage can be missed, or their diagnosis may be delayed. Here we present a case of a pregnant patient who presented with cerebral SAH. The source of hemorrhage was not initially identified, leading to a presumptive diagnosis of benign pretruncal non-aneurysmal SAH. The correct diagnosis of spinal thoracolumbar PMAVF was revealed 2.5 months later due to the progression of local symptoms. While the diagnosis was being refined and endovascular treatment was being planned (but delayed due to pregnancy), there was a recurrence of intraconal hemorrhage followed by brainstem hemorrhage. This led to significant clinical deterioration. The PMAVF was then treated microsurgically and the patient experienced partial recovery.',\n",

Patients with SMON typically suffer from abnormal dysesthesia in the lower limbs, which cannot explain the mechanism only in pathology and electrophysiology. Neuromodulation therapies are increasingly being investigated as a means of alleviating abnormal sensory disturbances. We report here the response to repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for dysesthesia in a patient with SMON. The patient underwent rTMS treatment once per week for 12 weeks. rTMS was administered at 10 Hz, 90% of the resting motor threshold over the bilateral primary motor cortex foot area, for a total of 1,500 stimuli per day. After the treatment had finished at 12 weeks, the abnormal dysesthesia gradually declined. At first, there were improvements only in the area with a feeling of adherence. Later, this sensation was eliminated. Three months following the application, most of the feeling of adherence had disappeared and the feeling of tightness was slightly reduced. In contrast, the throbbing feeling had not changed during this period. Dysesthesia may indicate a process of central sensitization, which would contribute to chronic neuromuscular dysfunction. This case suggests that rTMS is a promising therapeutic application for dysesthesia.',\n",

We operated on two small cAVMs with hematoma under a neuroendoscope, and the two patients obtained excellent results. Objective To explore the feasibility of treating cAVMs with a full transcranial neuroendoscopic approach. Methods The clinical data and operative techniques were collected and described for two patients who were diagnosed with cAVMs with hematoma and treated via a full transcranial neuroendoscopic approach. Results In the two patients, the hematomas were successfully evacuated, and the AVMs were removed simultaneously; both patients had achieved excellent recoveries at discharge. Conclusion To our knowledge, this is the first report in the literature to successfully treat cAVMs with hematoma with a full transcranial neuroendoscopic approach, showing that this approach is feasible and may be an alternative for small ruptured cAVMs. However, while the feasibility of attempting this approach was demonstrated, it was difficult to certify its obvious advantage.

       " 'Approximately 20% of patients with Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) develop optic pathway gliomas (OPGs). Not all OPGs in NF1 necessarily become vision compromising and predicting which patients might develop visual decline is difficult at present time. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has emerged as a useful tool able to directly assess the morphology and thickness of individual retinal layers. The ganglion cell layer (GCL) is composed of the retinal ganglion cells which receive information from photoreceptors via interneurons, while the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) contains the retinal ganglion cell unmyelinated axons that merge to form the optic nerve. Lesions of the anterior visual pathway result in retrograde axonal degeneration from ganglion cell death and ultimately manifest as thinning of the RNFL and/or GCL. In this report we highlight a case of a 38 year-old woman with an NF1 associated left chiasmal and optic tract glioma who had normal visual fields and visual acuity. However, using OCT we demonstrate a homonymous pattern of GCL atrophy that corresponds with her left optic tract glioma. Given this homonymous pattern of atrophy in the GCL and the left optic tract lesion, one would expect a right homonymous hemianopia. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of a homonymous pattern of GCL-IPL atrophy in an adult with an NF1 related OPG involving the optic chiasm and optic tract, but without objective visual field or acuity deficits. This case is important because, mechanistically, it suggests that a necessary threshold of GCL atrophy may be needed before visual concerns can be detected and, secondly, it invites future studies to evaluate whether OCT may serve as a potential screening tool for those with NF1 related OPGs.',\n",

Methods We describe the case of a 39-year-old conscious woman with CNH secondary to glioma brainstem infiltration for whom hyperventilation was aborted with hydromorphone, dexamethasone, and brainstem radiotherapy. We then performed a review of the literature on the treatment of CNH in conscious patients due to a CNS neoplasm. Results A total of 31 studies reporting 33 cases fulfilled the selection criteria. The underlying neoplasm was lymphoma in 15 (45%) and glioma in 13 (39%) patients. Overall, CNH was aborted in 70% of cases. Opioids and sedatives overall seemed useful for symptom relief, but the benefit was often of short duration when the medication was administered orally or subcutaneously. Methadone and fentanyl were successful but rarely used. Chemotherapy was most effective in patients with lymphoma (89%), but not glioma (0%) or other neoplasms (0%). Patients with lymphoma (80%) and other tumors (100%) responded to radiotherapy more frequently than patients with glioma (43%). Corticosteroids were moderately effective. Subtotal surgical resection was successful in the 3 cases for which it was attempted. Conclusion Definitive treatment of the underlying neoplasm may be more successful in aborting hyperventilation.

News reports and information about the virus are rapidly changing. We present a case of a patient with COVID-19 who had a seizure-like spell for which an EEG was performed. In early to mid-March, there were no clear guidelines or recommendations available from neurodiagnostic-related organizations or hospitals on how to adapt procedure workflow to those with COVID-19. When caring for COVID-19 patients, as when caring for any patient with an infectious disease, it is hospital protocol to follow contact, droplet/airborne precautions by wearing appropriate PPE. However, because we knew very little about the coronavirus, this case was different. In this article, we discuss our experience with our EEG workflow and concerns for staff exposure. We then discuss our adaptations and modifications to our standard procedures and protocols. A time analysis comparing our standard EEG protocol with our modified COVID-19 protocol revealed a significant decrease in technologist exposure time (99Â minutes versus 51Â minutes), which theoretically would reduce the chance of virus transmission to our technologist. At this critical moment in time, we hope such modifications will allow us to continue delivering high quality patient care while optimizing resource utilization and above all keeping our technologists safe.',\n",

On axial T2-cervical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a focal high signal change was observed in the central portion of the spinal cord at the C2 level. We deliberated that the patient's pain was due to the SCI observed on MRI, and after administration of oral medications, the NRS pain score reduced from 9 to 2. Conclusions Neuropathic pain caused by SCI varies according to the location and degree of injury of the pain-related neural tracts; therefore, clinicians should closely observe the pain patterns and findings on imaging in patients with SCI to determine the cause of pain accurately.\",\n",

The patient developed sudden onset of headache, nausea, and vomiting, immediately followed by loss of consciousness on the day of admission. Emergency medical services found him severely hypoxemic at home, and the patient suffered a cardiac arrest during transport to the emergency department. The emergency team achieved return of spontaneous circulation after over 17Â min of resuscitation. A chest radiograph revealed hazy bilateral opacities; and real-time-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 on the nasopharyngeal swab was positive. Computed tomography of the head showed a large right cerebellar hemorrhage, with tonsillar herniation and intraventricular hemorrhage. One day after presentation, he was transitioned to comfort care and died shortly after palliative extubation. Autopsy performed 3Â h after death showed cerebellar hemorrhage and acute infarcts in the dorsal pons and medulla.

       " 'Background Detection of brain-MRI T2/T2* gradient echo images (T2*GRE)-hypointensity can be compatible with iron accumulation and leads to a differential diagnosis work-up including neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA) and Wilson Disease. Idiopathic or secondary brain calcification can be also associated with neurological involvement and brain-MRI T2/T2*GRE-hypointensity. Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), characterized by systemic iron loading, usually does not involve the CNS, and only sporadic cases of neurological abnormalities or brain-MRI T2/T2*GRE-hypointensity have been reported. Case presentation A 59-year-old man came to our observation after a diagnosis of HH carried out in another hospital 2 years before. First-level genetic test had revealed a homozygous HFE p.Cys282Tyr (C282Y) mutation compatible with the diagnosis of HFE-related HH, thus phlebotomy treatment was started. The patient had a history of metabolic syndrome, type-2 diabetes, autoimmune thyroiditis and severe chondrocalcinosis. Brain-MRI showed the presence of bilateral T2*GRE hypointensities within globus pallidus, substantia nigra, dentate nucleus and left pulvinar that were considered expression of cerebral siderosis. No neurological symptoms or family history of neurological disease were reported. Neurological examination revealed only mild right-sided hypokinetic-rigid syndrome. Vitamin D–PTH axis, measurements of serum ceruloplasmin and copper, and urinary copper were within the normal range. A brain computed tomography (CT) was performed to better characterize the suspected and unexplained brain iron accumulation. On the CT images, the hypointense regions in the brain MRI were hyperdense. DNA sequence analysis of genes associated with primary familial brain calcification and NBIA was negative. Conclusions This report highlights the importance of brain CT-scan in ambiguous cases of suspected cerebral siderosis, and suggests that HH patients with a severe phenotype, and likely associated with chondrocalcinosis, may display also brain calcifications. Further studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis. So far, we can speculate that iron and calcium homeostasis could be reciprocally connected within the basal ganglia.',\n",

       " 'Background Stress cardiomyopathy (Takotsubo cardiomyopathy) is very rare in the central nervous system (CNS) demyelinating disorders. Although this dysfunction of the heart-brain axis has been reported in several case series related to multiple sclerosis (MS), stress cardiomyopathy by neuromyelitis optica (NMO), which is rarer CNS demyelinating disorder than MS, is extremely rare. Herein, we report a case of stress cardiomyopathy associated with a medullary lesion as a presentation of NMO. Case presentation A 30-year-old woman was treated by veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation due to catastrophic cardiopulmonary dysfunction after prolonged and unexplained nausea, vomiting, and cough. Myoclonus on the limbs developed afterward. Taken with suspicion of area postrema syndrome (APS), the brain MRI showed a demyelinating lesion in the medulla oblongata. APS and severe heart failure by stress cardiomyopathy were completely resolved by ECMO and hydrocortisone therapy. However, the CNS demyelinating lesion recurred after 1Â month. The patient was diagnosed with NMO evident by the presence of aquaporin-4 antibody; Steroid therapy improved her symptoms. Conclusion NMO should be considered as one of the differential diagnoses in patients with APS preceding severe cardiopulmonary distress.',\n",
       " 'Summary: The correlation of clinical semiology with neuronal firing in human seizures has not been well described. Similarly, the neuronal firing patterns underlying high-frequency oscillations during seizures remain controversial. Using implanted subdural electrodes and a microelectrode array in a patient with focal status epilepticus, in which 40 habitual focal motor seizures and 101 subclinical seizures were captured, the authors analyzed the association of EEG, high-frequency oscillations, and multiunit activity to facial motor semiology. The development of ictal high-frequency oscillations in subdural electrodes overlying face motor cortex was temporally associated with clonic facial movements. In representative seizures selected for multiunit analysis, synchronization of neuronal firing in the adjacent microelectrode array aligned with clinical onset and was greater in clinical seizures compared with subclinical seizures. This report demonstrates the electrophysiologic signatures of focal seizures at the level of neuronal firing, high-frequency oscillations, and EEG as they organize from microscale to macroscale, with clinical correlation.',\n",
       " 'The small-fiber polyneuropathies (SFN) are a class of diseases in which the small thin myelinated (AÎ´) and/or unmyelinated (C) fibers within peripheral nerves malfunction and can degenerate. SFN usually begins in the farthest, most-vulnerable axons, so distal neuropathic pain and symptoms from micro-vascular dysregulation are common. It is well known in adults, e.g. from diabetes, human immunodeficiency virus, or neurotoxins, but considered extremely rare in children, linked mostly with pathogenic genetic variants in voltage-gated sodium channels. However, increasing evidence suggests that pediatric SFN is not rare, and that dysimmunity is the most common cause. Because most pediatric neurologists are unfamiliar with SFN, we report the diagnosis and management of 5 Swiss children, aged 6–11y, who presented with severe paroxysmal burning pain in the hands and feet temporarily relieved by cooling—the erythromelalgia presentation. Medical evaluations revealed autoimmune diseases in 3 families and 3/5 had preceding or concomitant infections. The standard diagnostic test (PGP9.5-immunolabeled lower-leg skin biopsy) confirmed SFN diagnoses in 3/4, and autonomic function testing (AFT) was abnormal in 2/3. Blood testing for etiology was unrevealing, including genetic testing in 3. Paracetamol and ibuprofen were ineffective. Two children responded to gabapentin plus mexiletine, one to carbamazepine, two to mexiletine plus immunotherapy (methylprednisolone/IVIg). All recovered within 6 months, remaining well for years. These monophasic tempos and therapeutic responses are most consistent with acute post-infectious immune-mediated causality akin to Guillain-BarrÃ© large-fiber polyneuropathy. Skin biopsy and AFT for SFN, neuropathic-pain medications and immunotherapy should be considered for acute sporadic pediatric erythromelalgia.',\n",
       " 'Nitrous oxide, often used as an anesthetic agent, is also increasingly a drug of abuse due to its euphoric and anxiolytic effects. Frequent exposure to nitrous oxide can lead to neurologic complications, including B12 deficiency and resultant subacute myeloneuropathy, as well as direct neurotoxicity. A clinical presentation of acute sensorimotor polyneuropathy mimicking Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome after chronic nitrous oxide abuse has been reported only rarely. Here we present a 17-year-old previously healthy girl presented with 10 days of progressive ascending sensory loss and weakness in the legs. She admitted to heavy nitrous oxide abuse over a period of a year or more. Laboratory evaluation was significant for normal vitamin B12 level with elevated homocysteine. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of her spine showed abnormal signal involving the bilateral dorsal columns. Nerve conduction studies were suggestive of severe axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy. This patient demonstrates concurrent multifactorial neurologic injury as a result of nitrous oxide abuse. She had a functional vitamin B12 deficiency as indicated by the elevated homocysteine, leading to a subacute combined degeneration that was evident on the MRI. In addition, she had evidence of direct neurotoxicity leading to axonal injury and sensorimotor polyneuropathy reminiscent of Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome. This clinical picture is a serious but seldom reported possible complication if nitrous oxide abuse and should be considered in patients presenting with a clinical picture suspicious for Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome or its variants.',\n",

Case presentation Here, we report a case of fluent conversation with a person in a mirror or a magazine, and examine the underlying mechanism using brain imaging and neuropsychological findings. We found that the appearance of the mirror phenomenon may be associated with a visuospatial dysfunction caused by a decreased function of the posterior region of the right temporal and parietal lobe. Moreover, active talking to a person in a mirror or a person in a magazine could be associated with disinhibition caused by a decline in bilateral frontal lobe function. Conclusions This case represents a very valuable and interesting presentation because it is the first report of a long-term follow-up of the course of dementia using neurological imaging, and of the neuropsychological analysis of the mechanism of conversation with a mirror image combined with aphasia.',\n",

He made full recovery as his blood pressure was controlled and clinical status was supported with appropriate supportive therapy. Although traditionally a rare condition, PRES is likely to be more common among patients with COVID-19 pathobiology there is Renin downregulation of ACE2 receptors, involvement of Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone system, endotheliitis, cytokine storm, and hyper-immune response. Thus we advocate clinical suspicion and early brain imaging with MRI brain among vulnerable patients with known co-morbidities, and diagnosed with COVID-19 given that hypertension and blood pressure variability are often exacerbated by acute SARS-CoV-2 immune reactions. Such acute hypertensive encephalopathy was able to be reversed with timely supportive therapy ensuring re-hydration and re-establishment of blood pressure control.',\n",

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) showed spinal cord compression by the left PFIA at the C1/C2 level. Because conservative treatment was ineffective, microvascular decompression (MVD) of the PFIA was performed. The left PFIA was laterally transposed using polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) bands and anchored to the dura mater using three PTFE bands. To achieve adequate transposition, the small blood vessels bridging the spinal cord and PFIA and the dorsal root nerve had to be sacrificed. Postoperative T2-weighted MRI showed a small hyperintense region in the lateral funiculus of the spinal cord, but no new neurological deficits were identified. In the early postoperative stage, the patient's deep sensory impairment and motor dysfunction were improved. His numbness and burning sensation almost disappeared, but slight thermal hypoalgesia remained in the lower limb. Conclusion MVD is an effective treatment for spinal cord compression caused by the PFIA, but further studies are necessary to help address technical difficulties and avoid complications.\",\n",

CSF neurofilament light chain (NFL) levels were assessed in this patient together with 7 additional HaNDL patients, 18 multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, and 15 primary headache patients. Both HaNDL and primary headache patients showed significantly lower NFL levels than MS patients.

Both unilateral small lesions were localized in the right lateral funiculus, and each patient showed good prognosis. The anatomical findings suggested that the pial collateral network surrounding the cervical cord contributed to lesion formation.

However, the increase of those therapies is associated with novel toxicities, mainly immune-related adverse events (irAEs), never observed before. Different irAEs are now well characterized, and, among them, neuromuscular complications, following immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICPi) therapy, are increasingly studied and described. However, there are also neurological complications related to the use of other targeted therapies, less known and probably underestimated. Herein we describe two oncological patients who developed neuromuscular diseases after administration of targeted therapies, different from ICPi. Case reports The first patient was treated with the combination of Vemurafenib and Cobimetinib, BRAF and MEK inhibitors, respectively, for a cutaneous melanoma. One year after the beginning of the combined treatment, she developed a sub-acute motor neuropathy with predominant cranial nerve involvement. She was successfully treated with methylprednisolone. The second patient received therapy with Imatinib, tyrosine kinase inhibitor and precursor of the targeted therapy, for a gastrointestinal stromal tumour. Few days after the first administration, he developed generalized myasthenia gravis with respiratory failure.

Discussion andÂ Conclusion We strengthen the relevance of neuromuscular complications which may occur long after treatment start or in patients receiving not only the latest ICPi but also \"older\" and apparently better-known targeted therapies. Also in the latter cases, an immune-mediated \"off-target\" pathogenic mechanism can be hypothesized, and consequences can be life threatening, if not promptly diagnosed and appropriately managed.',\n",
       " 'Background Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is a chronic progressive neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by the discovery of eosinophilic hyaline intranuclear inclusions in the central and peripheral nervous systems and visceral organs. In this paper, we report a case of an adult-onset neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease presenting with mental abnormality in China. Case presentation A 62-year-old woman presented with mental abnormality and forgetfulness for 3 months before she was admitted to our hospital. There were prodromal symptoms of fever before she had the mental disorder. Encephalitis was first suspected, and the patient underwent lumbar puncture and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination indicated normal pressure, a normal white blood cell count, and slightly elevated protein and glucose levels. Coxsackie B virus, enterovirus, and cytomegalovirus tests showed normal results. Bacterial culture and Cryptococcus neoformans Conclusions NIID is a rare neurodegenerative disease with diverse clinical manifestations. In clinical work, when a patient presents with abnormal mental behavior and exhibits hyperintensity signals on DWI images of the corticomedullary junction, it is crucial to consider the diagnosis of NIID.',\n",
       " 'Dysphagia after stroke impacts quality of life and is a risk factor for respiratory infections. Patients frequently require prophylactic measures including nasogastric tube or percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy. Until recently, therapy for dysphagia was limited to training with a speech and language specialist. Intraluminal pharyngeal electrical stimulation (PES) is a new technique that stimulates the pharyngeal sensory afferents to the higher swallowing center in cortex. The clinical trials published to date involved stimulation for 10 minutes over three days. We present a case of brainstem infarction with severe dysphagia in a 53-year-old woman with preserved cognitive functions. For airway protection, she had a surgical tracheotomy. The initial swallowing training achieved slight improvements, but stagnated after three months so PES was tried. Under good PES tube tolerance, a prolonged and repeated stimulation protocol was administered, with the main purpose of relieving her of the tracheal tube. Although the swallowing improved, she stayed tube-dependent with minimal attempts with purÃ©ed food during therapy, and could not be decannulated. Further studies are required to assess the value of this promising approach for the treatment of dysphagia.',\n",
       " 'Introduction: The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is a global pandemic. Although the main clinical manifestation of COVID-19 is respiratory involvement, there is evidence suggesting the neuroinvasive potential of COVID-19. There are limited reports of neurological complications of COVID-19 infection in the literature. Herein, we aim to describe 2 members of a family affected by COVID-19, presenting with ascending paresthesia with the final diagnosis of Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome. Case Report: A 38-year-old man presented with a history of ascending paresthesia and bilateral facial droop since 5 days before admission. The medical history was positive for flu-like symptoms affecting all the members of his family. The neurological examination was notable for bilateral peripheral facial paralysis, generalized areflexia, and derceased sensation in distal limbs. The cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed an albuminocytologic dissociation. In addition, the electromyography-nerve conduction study findings were suggestive of acute axonal-demyelinating polyneuropathy. Meanwhile the patient was treated with a diagnosis of Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome, his 14-year-old daughter presented with a history of progressive paresthesia and weakness. Similar to her father, the paraclinical evaluations were consistent with Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome. Taking into account clinical findings and the outbreak of COVID-19, the suspicion of COVID-19 was proposed. Eventually, on the basis of throat swab samples stand on polymerase chain reaction, the patients were diagnosed with COVID-19. Conclusion: Our cases revealed the familial occurrence of Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome after COVID-19 infection. The authors emphasize neurological complications of COVID-19.',\n",

       " \"Background Taste disorder is a common symptom in the general population. Several studies have shown that patients with neurological disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Parkinson's disease, develop taste disturbance. Facial onset sensory and motor neuronopathy (FOSMN) is a rare disease characterized by sensory disturbance and weakness spreading from the face to the limbs caudally. We describe a patient with FOSMN who showed taste disorder as the sole initial symptom. Case presentation A 49-year-old man who smoked cigarettes developed taste disturbance. Despite using zinc supplements, an herbal medication, and an ointment, his taste disorder worsened. 4 years later, a tingling feeling emerged at the tip of his tongue and gradually spread to his entire lips. At 55â\\x80\\x89years of age, he showed difficulty in swallowing, followed by facial paresthesia, muscle atrophy, and weakness in the face and upper limbs without apparent upper motor neuron sign. Cessation of smoking did not improve his taste disturbance, and he was unable to discriminate different tastes on the entire tongue. In an electrogustometric study, electrical stimulation did not induce any type of taste sensation. Blink reflex showed delayed or diminished R2 responses. Needle electromyography revealed severe chronic neurogenic changes in the tongue and masseter muscles. Mild chronic neurogenic changes were also observed in the limbs. In the thoracic paraspinal muscles, active neurogenic changes were detected. Findings of hematological and cerebrospinal fluid analyses, and magnetic resonance images of the brain and spinal cord were unremarkable. One cycle of intravenous immunoglobulin therapy did not improve his symptoms. We diagnosed him as having FOSMN with the sole initial symptom of taste disorder. Nine years after the onset of taste disorder, he developed impaired sensation of touch in the right upper limb and required tube feeding and ventilator support. Conclusion Taste disorder can be the initial manifestation of FOSMN and might involve the solitary nucleus.\",\n",

       " 'Occasionally, acute ischemic stroke can be difficult to differentiate from acute intracranial infection. We describe a patient who presented with sudden onset of right hemiparesis and fever. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was consistent with an acute stroke, showing multiple lesions with restricted diffusion in the left middle cerebral artery territory. These lesions were not enhancing and were not associated with vasogenic edema. A diagnosis of acute stroke was made based on the clinical and radiographic data. Follow-up MRI obtained eleven days later showed interval development of ring enhancement and vasogenic edema surrounding the previously noted core of restricted diffusion. Based on these findings, the diagnosis was revised to cerebral abscesses and the patient was treated successfully with antibiotics. In retrospect, the largest diffusion-weighted lesion on baseline MRI demonstrated two characteristics that were atypical for stroke: it had an ovoid shape and a subtle T2 hypointense core. This case demonstrates that acute clinical and radiographic presentation of cerebral abscess and ischemic stroke can be strikingly similar. Follow-up imaging can be instrumental in arriving at an accurate diagnosis.',\n",

       " 'A 25 year-old Nigerian woman with aquaporin-4 antibody-positive neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) presented with a 6 week history of nausea, vomiting, and refractory hiccups; as well as progressive lower extremity sensory loss, weakness, saddle anesthesia, and urinary incontinence. She had experienced her first NMOSD relapse seven years prior with bilateral lower extremity weakness and area postrema syndrome. After pulse steroids and plasma exchange she made a complete neurologic recovery and was started on azathioprine. An initial aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody ELISA test was positive, but three subsequent tests were negative and repeat MRI brain showed resolution of T2/FLAIR signal abnormalities with the exception of a right thalamic lesion and a left medullary lesion. Azathioprine was discontinued after 1 year and she was lost to follow-up. With her second relapse, she had new lesions in her left thalamus and right medulla—a mirror image of the thalamic and medullary lesions associated with her first relapse. In addition, an MRI spine demonstrated a new longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis from T7 to L1 with edematous expansion of the cord. Her serum AQP4 antibody test using a cell-based assay was strongly positive. NMOSD lesions are typically associated with brain regions with high density of the AQP4 channel. These areas include optic nerves, hypothalamus, and the diencephalic and brainstem tissues that surround the cerebral aqueduct and third and fourth ventricles. Previous studies have demonstrated that those with relapsing NMOSD have a predilection for recurrence in the same neuroanatomical region as their first episode. We hypothesize, using data from prior pathologic and epidemiologic studies, that mirror image lesions, where the same anatomic sites are affected on the contralateral side of the brain or spinal cord, may appear in subsequent attacks due to (i) areas of high remaining AQP4 density and/or (ii) local compromise of astrocyte or blood-brain barrier (BBB) function that persists after the initial inciting attack.',\n",

Electrophysiological improvements after short-term treatment have been described in large cohorts of CIDP patients, but the magnitude of the changes is small and might be obscured in individual patients due to the variation inherent in nerve conduction testing. We present the case of a CIDP patient treated successfully with immunosuppression and followed for 31 years with serial standardized clinical and electrophysiological evaluations. Improvement in electrophysiological parameters lagged clinical changes for up to 2 years, but all motor parameters improved (distal motor and F wave latencies, conduction velocities, and compound muscle action potential amplitudes) even with evidence of initial axonal damage. Worsening of electrophysiological parameters, specifically increasing F wave latencies, heralded clinical relapse by as much as a year. Electrophysiological parameters do improve with treatment in CIDP patients, although the changes can take up to 2 years, and also worsening electrophysiological parameters can herald clinical relapse and might help guide therapeutic decisions.',\n",

Few reports have documented SLEs in the cerebellum. The clinical neuroimaging features of cerebellar SLEs have not been fully investigated. We report distinctive features of cerebellar stroke-like lesions (SLLs) in a case of MELAS with m.3243Aâ\\x80\\x89>â\\x80\\x89G mutation. Case presentation A 47-year-old Japanese man with type-2 diabetes presented to our hospital with acute onset of aphasia. A brain MRI obtained on admission (day 1) showed increased diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI)/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) signal in the left anterolateral temporal lobe, which subsequently spread along the cortex posteriorly accompanied by a new lesion in the right anterior temporal lobe. The patient was initially treated with acyclovir and subsequently with immunotherapy. However, on day 45, cerebellar ataxia developed. The brain MRI showed extensive increased DWI/FLAIR signals in the cerebellum along the folia without involvement of deep cerebellar nucleus or cerebellar peduncle; SLLs were incongruent with a vascular territory, similarly to classic cerebral SLLs. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map did not show reduction in ADC values in the affected folia. Genomic analysis revealed m.3243Aâ\\x80\\x89>â\\x80\\x89G mutation (heteroplasmy in leukocytes, 17%), confirming the diagnosis of MELAS.

       " \"Manganese accumulation in the central nervous system creates clinical symptoms of cognitive dysfunction, behavioral changes, and movement disorders resembling Parkinson's disease. Radiographic features of this rare clinical entity include symmetric T1 hyperintensities in the bilateral globus pallidi, with corresponding hypointensities on T2-weighted images. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is an increasingly used potentially lifesaving therapy for patients who cannot tolerate enteral nutrition. However, when used over a period of several weeks to months, its associated risks and complications carry significant morbidity and mortality. One of the more rare complications of TPN use is manganese toxicity. We provided care for a 38-year-old female on chronic TPN who presented to the hospital with Parkinsonian features, confusion, falls, and lethargy. MRI brain showed T1 hyperintensities in the bilateral globus pallidi, which were attributed to manganese toxicity from chronic TPN use. Supporting evidence for this rare entity included decreased signal intensity in the bilateral globus pallidi on T2-weighted images and T1 hyperintensities in the substantia nigra. With antifungal treatment and permanent cessation of TPN, her mentation and neurological symptoms began to improve within a week. Repeat MRI brain performed one month after discontinuation of TPN revealed improvement of the T1 hyperintensities in the bilateral globus pallidi. Our objective in presenting this case is to highlight manganese neurotoxicity as a rare complication of TPN in a patient without known hepatic dysfunction and to emphasize the importance of routinely monitoring patients for the possible adverse effects of chronic TPN. Our case is among the handful of published cases in which a patient without known liver dysfunction, which is the primary organ responsible for manganese elimination from the body, developed manganese neurotoxicity.\",\n",

The aim of this study was to identify functional activity in the cerebral cortex after a hypoxic event and to investigate alterations that could be modulated by deep brain stimulation (DBS). A voxel-based subtraction analysis of serial positron emission tomography (PET) scans was performed in a 34-year-old woman with chronic medically refractory PHM that improved with bilateral globus pallidus internus (Gpi) DBS implanted three years after the hypoxic event. The patient required low-frequency stimulation to show myoclonus improvement. Using voxel-based statistical parametric mapping, we identified a decrease in glucose metabolism in the prefrontal lobe including the dorsolateral, orbito-, and inferior prefrontal cortex, which was suspected to be the origin of the myoclonus from postoperative PET/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after DBS. Based on the present study results, voxel-based subtraction of PET appears to be a useful approach for monitoring patients with PHM treated with DBS. Further investigation and continuous follow-up on the use of PET analysis and DBS treatment for patients with PHM are necessary to help understanding the pathophysiology of PHM, or LAS.',\n",
       " 'Background Continuous electroencephalography (cEEG) is an important neuromonitoring tool in brain injured patients. It is commonly used for detection of seizure but can also be used to monitor changes in cerebral blood flow. One such event that can cause a change in cerebral blood flow is imminent, cerebral herniation. cEEG monitoring and quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG) can be used as neurotelemetry to detect cerebral herniation prior to onset of clinical signs. Case presentation We discuss two cases highlighting the use of cEEG in cerebral herniation accompanied by clinical examination changes. The first case is a patient with multiorgan failure and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Given his coagulopathy status, his ICH expanded. The second case is a patient with intraventricular hemorrhage and worsening obstructive hydrocephalus. In both cases, the cEEG showed increasing regional/lateralized slowing. The Quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG) showed a decrease in frequencies, worsening asymmetry, decreasing amplitude and increasing burst suppression ratio corresponding with the ongoing herniation. Clinically, these changes on cEEG preceded the bedside neurological changes by up to 1â\\x80\\x89h. Conclusions The use of cEEG to monitor patients at high risk for herniation syndromes may identify changes earlier than bedside clinical exam. This earlier identification may allow for an earlier opportunity to intervene.',\n",

Additionally, thymic neuroendocrine tumors in MEN1 are also rarely reported. Case presentation This case report observed a family that presented with MEN1 p.L105Vfs mutation, and two of the family members had been diagnosed with thymic neuroendocrine tumor combined with MEN1. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time such a mutation in the MEN1 gene has been reported. The proband presented with thymic neuroendocrine tumor, parathyroid adenoma and rectum adenocarcinoma. The son of the proband presented with thymic neuroendocrine tumor, gastrinoma, hypophysoma and parathyroid adenoma. Genetic testing revealed the frameshift mutation p.L105Vfs, leading to the identification of one carrier in the pedigree (the patient's younger sister).

      "ABSTRACT At the end of 2019, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China. On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. This virus affects many organs, including the eye, and can manifest through various clinical manifestations. Multiple neuro-ophthalmological manifestations have been reported in association with COVID-19, including, Optic Neuritis, cranial nerve palsies, eye movement abnormalities, and visual field defects. In this article, we report a case of bilateral neuroretinitis in association with (SARS-CoV-2). -> ['disease', 'anatomy', 'molecule', 'phenotype']\n",
      "Background Patients suffering from refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) who have undergone deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery require repeated in-person programming visits. These sessions could be labor-intensive and may not always be feasible, particularly when in-person hospital visits are restricted. Telemedicine is emerging as a potential supplementary tool for post-operative care. However, its reliability and feasibility still require further validation due to the unconventional methods of interaction. Methods A study was conducted on three patients with refractory OCD who had undergone DBS. Most of their programming sessions were completed via a remote programming system. These patients were recruited and monitored for a year. Changes in their clinical symptoms were assessed using the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale–Second Edition (Y-BOCS-II), the Hamilton Anxiety Scale-14 (HAMA), the Hamilton Depression Scale-17 (HAMD), and the Short Form 36 Health Survey Questionnaire (SF-36). The scores from these assessments were reported. Results At the last follow-up, two out of three patients were identified as responders, with their Y-BOCS-II scores improving by more than 35% (P1: 51%, P3: 42%). These patients also experienced some mood benefits. All patients observed a decrease in travel expenses during the study period. No severe adverse events were reported throughout the study. Conclusion The group of patients showed improvement in their OCD symptoms within a 1-year follow-up period after DBS surgery, without compromising safety or benefits. This suggests that telemedicine could be a valuable supplementary tool when in-person visits are limited. -> ['treatment', 'phenotype', 'cognitive', 'disease', 'medical_procedures']\n",
      "Background and Objective Spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) from CSF leak commonly produces headache. It also may produce sagging brain syndrome (SBS), often with neurocognitive symptoms indistinguishable from behavioral-variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). The authors describe a new clinical sign that appears to be pathognomonic of SBS. Methods We reviewed medical records and brain imaging in patients seen at our 2 centers who presented with SIH, SBS, and bvFTD symptoms. Results There were 51 patients (12 women, 39 men) with mean age 55.5 years (range, 26–70 years). MRI showed severe brain sagging in all. Thirteen patients displayed repetitive flexion with breath-holding at the time of clinical presentation. Five patients had repetitive flexion with breath-holding, which resolved before presenting for evaluation. Thus, 35.3% (18) of 51 patients with SBS displayed seemingly compulsive repetitive flexion with breath-holding. Discussion Compulsive repetitive flexion with breath-holding appears to be pathognomonic of SBS, deserving the acronym CoRFBiS (compulsive repetitive flexion with breath-holding in SBS). CoRFBiS should alert the clinician to SBS with SIH as the proximate cause of the clinical constellation, rather than bvFTD. -> ['metadata', 'phenotype', 'cognitive', 'disease', 'medical_procedures']\n",
      "Combined central and peripheral demyelination (CCPD) is an extremely rare disease characterized by inflammatory demyelination in both the central and peripheral nervous systems. Herein, we reported case of a 14-year-old teenager who initially presented with the symptoms of acute myelitis (AM). Subsequently, the patient developed symptoms consistent with Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome (GBS), which was supported by nerve conduction studies (NCV) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. Throughout the course of the disease, the patient experienced abdominal pain and abnormal liver function. After a comprehensive evaluation, we determined that the abnormal liver function was a result of hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection, which may have acted as a trigger for GBS. The patient was treated with corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin and Rituximab, resulting in symptom relief and clinical improvement after therapy and follow-up. This case highlights the potential responsiveness and reversibility of CCPD. Given the heterogeneous nature of CCPD, there is currently no standardized diagnostic criteria or clear consensus on its treatment. Therefore, we recommend a thorough assessment of all possibilities and the development of consolidated management guidelines based on available data for this disorder. -> ['treatment', 'phenotype', 'anatomy', 'disease', 'medical_procedures']\n",
      "Autoimmune glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) astrocytopathy is a recently emerging autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS); GFAP astrocytopathy is characterized by optic neuritis and meningoencephalomyelitis. We report the case of a 55-year-old man, otherwise healthy, who presented with isolated headaches for three months, without other features of meningoencephalitis or myelitis. His neurological examination and fundoscopy were unremarkable. Gadolinium-enhanced brain MRI demonstrated increased T2 hyperintensity within the right sub-lenticular basal ganglia, with additional leptomeningeal enhancement along the bilateral perisylvian regions and mesial temporal lobes. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed lymphocytic pleocytosis, elevated protein, matching oligoclonal bands, and a negative infectious and cytological workup. Cell-based assays for anti-aquaporin-4, anti-myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein, autoimmune encephalitis panel, and vasculitis workup were all negative, except for CSF positivity for GFAP Î± antibody. Oncological screening, including CT of the chest, abdomen, pelvis, and scrotal US, was unremarkable. Immunotherapy with high-dose intravenous steroids for five days and subsequent single four-weekly doses resulted in the resolution of both clinical and radiographic features, with a maintained status 24âmonths after onset. This case highlights isolated headache and basal ganglia, mesial temporal lobe involvement as a rare presentation of autoimmune GFAP astrocytopathy. -> ['treatment', 'protein', 'phenotype', 'anatomy', 'disease', 'medical_procedures', 'brain_atlas', 'molecule']\n",
      "Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is a rare, progressive neurodegenerative disorder known for its diverse clinical manifestations. Although episodic neurogenic events can be associated with NIID, no reported cases have demonstrated concurrent clinical features or MRI findings resembling reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS). Here, we present the inaugural case of an adult-onset NIID patient who initially displayed symptoms reminiscent of RCVS. The 59-year-old male patient's initial presentation included a thunderclap headache, right visual field deficit, and confusion. Although his brain MRI appeared normal, MR angiography unveiled left posterior cerebral artery occlusion, subsequently followed by recanalization, culminating in an RCVS diagnosis. Over an 11-year period, the patient encountered 10 additional episodes, each escalating in duration and intensity, accompanied by seizures. Simultaneously, cognitive impairment progressed. Genetic testing for NIID revealed an abnormal expansion of GGC repeats in NOTCH2NLC -> ['treatment', 'phenotype', 'anatomy', 'cognitive', 'gene', 'disease', 'medical_procedures', 'molecule']\n",
      "Background Familial cerebral cavernous malformations (FCCM) is a rare autosomal dominant disease, characterized by vascular malformations that can lead to macro and microhemorrhages. The neurocognitive impact of FCCM is still underrecognized. Methods We report the clinical, neurocognitive, imaging and genetic data of a three generation family with FCCM. Results A 63-year-old man (proband) had progressive memory impairment since the last year. Neurologic exam was unremarkable. Brain MRI showed multiple large cavernomas (mainly in the pons, left temporal, and right temporo-parietal) and scattered microhemorrhages. Neuropsychological assessment mainly revealed left frontal and right temporo-parietal dysfunction. A 41-year-old daughter, presented with headache, vertigo and memory complaints in the last 2 years. Neurological examination revealed left central facial paralysis. Brain MRI showed two small right parietal and internal capsule cavernomas, as well as microhemorrhages. Neuropsychological assessment showed moderate temporal neocortical left dysfunction. A 34-year-old daughter had recurrent headache and memory complaints, with unremarkable neurological exam. Brain MRI revealed two large cavernomas (left fronto-orbitary and inferior temporal), with few microhemorrhages. Neuropsychological assessment was normal. A granddaughter had mild headaches and a small right cerebellar cavernoma, without microhemorrhages. Neuropsychological assessment showed mild temporal neocortical left dysfunction. A nonsense variant, c.55Câ>âT; p.R19* generating a premature stop codon in CCM2 Conclusions Neuropsychological evaluation showed that memory complaints and cognitive impairment could be an important unrecognized finding in FCCM. Its pathophysiological mechanisms are still unknown but the role of recurrent microhemorrhages could provide an interesting hypothesis. -> ['phenotype', 'anatomy', 'cognitive', 'gene', 'disease', 'medical_procedures', 'brain_atlas']\n",
      "Pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN) is a rare autosomal recessive hereditary neurodegenerative disorder, usually caused by mutations in the pantothenate kinase 2 (PANK2) gene. We report a young female patient with atypical PKAN, harboring a novel heterozygous PANK2 mutation, diagnosed through clinical imaging and genetic analysis. The patient presented with dystonia and motor dysfunction after onset, but early brain MRI showed normal findings. Due to progressive symptom deterioration, her MRI was reevaluated and the characteristic \"eye of the tiger\" sign was identified. Further genetic testing revealed that she was a carrier of two heterozygous PANK2 mutations, one being a known pathogenic variant and the other unknown. Given the patient's clinical presentation, progressive symptoms, and poor response to medication, we boldly attempted asymmetric bilateral deep brain stimulation (abDBS). Postoperative outcomes showed significant symptom improvement. This study suggests that early brain MRI in PKAN patients may not exhibit typical radiological features, leading to potential diagnostic omissions. Furthermore, it highlights the potential therapeutic effect of abDBS in atypical PKAN, particularly in patients with novel heterozygous PANK2 mutations. Asymmetric bilateral deep brain stimulation may represent a promising treatment approach. -> ['treatment', 'phenotype', 'gene', 'disease', 'medical_procedures']\n",
      "Background Neuroleptospirosis and anti-dipeptidyl-peptidase-like protein 6 (DPPX) encephalitis are both very rare and have only been reported in the form of respective case reports. There are no reports of anti-DPPX encephalitis combined with neuroleptospirosis in the literature. We reported the first case of neuroleptospirosis combined with elevated DPPX antibodies in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Case presentation A previously healthy 53-year-old Chinese male farmer with a history of drinking raw stream water and flood sewage exposure was brought to the hospital due to an acute onset of neuropsychiatric symptoms. No fever or meningeal irritation signs were detected on physical examination. Routine laboratory investigations, including infection indicators, leukocyte and protein in CSF, electroencephalogram and gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, all revealed normal. While metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) identified the DNA genome of Leptospira interrogans Conclusion We highlight that in patients with acute or subacute behavioral changes, even in the absence of fever, if the most recent freshwater exposure is clear, physicians should pay attention to leptospirosis. Due to the low sensitivity of routine microscopy, culture, polymerase chain reaction and antibody testing, mNGS may have more advantages in diagnosing neuroleptospirosis. As autoimmune encephalitis can be triggered by various infections, neuroleptospirosis may be one of the causes of autoimmune encephalitis. Since neuronal antibody measurements themselves are not that common in neuroleptospirosis, future studies are needed to determine whether the detection of anti-DPPX antibodies is a rare event in leptospirosis. Early identification of autoimmune encephalitis and timely administration of immunotherapy may lead to a better outcome.

      "Penetrating brain trauma is rare. We present a unique case involving a sugarcane injury that penetrated the brain via the orbit following a road traffic accident. A 32-year-old male arrived at our emergency department with a penetrating injury to his left eye. A non-contrast computerized tomography (NCCT) scan of the head showed a foreign body in the left orbit, extending to the frontal lobe. Left frontotemporal craniotomy, anterior cranial fossa exploration, retrieval of the foreign body (a sugarcane piece), and dural repair of the anterior cranial fossa were performed. The patient was discharged and showed positive progress on follow-up. Penetrating trauma to the eyes and brain can be fatal, leading to vision loss. Therefore, early surgical intervention and close coordination between ophthalmologists and neurosurgeons are imperative. -> ['treatment', 'phenotype', 'anatomy', 'disease', 'medical_procedures']\n",
      "Chorea-acanthocytosis (ChAc) is a rare, neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in the VPS13A gene. In this article, we report on a 32-year-old man diagnosed with ChAc, with involuntary movements of the mouth and trunk, drooling of the mouth, slurred speech, and abnormal vocalizations as the main clinical manifestations. Three weeks after implantation of globus pallidus internal (GPi)-deep brain stimulation (DBS), the patient's symptoms improved significantly. For example, articulation is clear, involuntary trunk movements and salivation have largely disappeared, and abnormal vocalizations have been significantly reduced. After 1âyear of follow-up, the improvement in involuntary movement symptoms is essentially the same as before. As far as we know, we are the first to report the relief of involuntary vocalizations in a patient with GPi-DBS treatment, and that salivation and involuntary trunk movements have almost disappeared, and all other symptoms are significantly relieved, which is rare in previous cases. All of the above proves that the treatment of our case with DBS was very successful and that longer term follow-up is critical. We also hope that our case will provide new references and therapeutic ideas for the future treatment of patients with ChAc. -> ['treatment', 'phenotype', 'gene', 'anatomy', 'disease', 'medical_procedures']\n",
      "SUMMARY: We describe 2 cases of a spinal cord lesion with imaging features closely resembling those described in supratentorial multinodular and vacuolating neuronal tumor (MVNT) or infratentorial multinodular and vacuolating posterior fossa lesions of unknown significance. Multiple well-delineated nonenhancing T2-hyperintense intramedullary cystic ovoid nodules were visualized within the white matter of the spinal cord, including some immediately abutting the gray matter. No alterations in signal intensity or morphology were detected in a follow-up. Moreover, no relevant clinical symptoms attributable to the lesions were present. We describe these lesions as presumed MVNT, and we therefore use the term MVNT-like spinal cord lesions. -> ['phenotype', 'anatomy', 'medical_procedures', 'disease']\n",
      "Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is a rare autoimmune disorder of the central nervous system characterized by recurrent, disabling attacks that affect the optic nerve, spinal cord, and brain/brainstem. While rituximab, targeting CD20-positive B-cells, is used as an off-label therapy for NMOSD, some patients continue to exhibit breakthrough attacks and/or adverse reactions. Inebilizumab, a humanized and glycoengineered monoclonal antibody targeting CD19-positive B-cells, has been FDA approved for the treatment of NMOSD in adult patients who are anti-aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody positive. Given the limited real-world data on the efficacy and safety of inebilizumab, especially in those transitioning from rituximab, a retrospective chart review was conducted on 14 NMOSD patients from seven centers.

      "Background We present a rare case of NeuroBehcet's-related intracranial hypertension without cerebral venous thrombosis (NBrIHwCVT), occurring as the first presentation of NeuroBehcet's. In addition, we describe the novel use of subcutaneous tocilizumab for this indication. This is followed by a review of the literature on this topic. Case The patient was a 28-year-old lady of Southern Chinese origin with a known history of Behcet's disease with oral ulcers and ocular findings for which she was on mycophenolate mofetil and adalimumab. She presented with a headache and bilateral disc swelling associated with an intracranial pressure (ICP) of >â40cmH20. There were no structural lesions or cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) on imaging. Initial lumbar puncture had raised leucocytes and protein. We discuss diagnostic challenges given persistently elevated ICP despite subsequent non-inflammatory cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) profiles and non-response to acetazolamide. She eventually showed a response to immunosuppressant therapy in the form of pulsed methylprednisolone, cyclophosphamide and subsequently subcutaneous tocilizumab, supporting the diagnosis of NBrIHwCVT. Complete normalization of ICP remains challenging. Her disease course was severe, unusual for her ethnicity. Literature review We identified 34 patients (including ours) from 14 publications. We found that the majority of NBrIHwCVT patients were young (average age of 34 years), with a slight female preponderance. Of the 17 cases in the literature with available data on CSF profile, none had raised leucocytes whilst one patient had elevated protein. Patients were generally treated with steroids and occasionally azathioprine, in line with the suspected autoimmune pathophysiology. Of 22 patients with data on outcome, six (27%) were noted to have recurrence of symptoms generally occurring a few months later. Conclusion As demonstrated by this case, NBrIHwCVT can present with BD with raised ICP even if there is no prior history of NB, central Asian ethnicity, cerebral venous thrombosis or features of inflammation on the CSF. We demonstrated how novel use of Tocilizumab may have a role in the management of NBrIHwCVT. Based on our literature review, patients were more likely to be young, female, display a non-inflammatory CSF picture, be treated with steroids and harbour a possibility of recurrence. -> ['treatment', 'protein', 'phenotype', 'disease', 'medical_procedures']\n",

      "Background Pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) has not been reported before. This study presents a patient with NMOSD who developed PRCA. Case presentation A 54-year-old female was admitted in January 2023 for dysuria and progressive numbness and weakness of lower limbs. She had difficulty standing and walking in a straight line. Both lower limbs were positive for the Babinski and Chaddock signs. MRI showed abnormal signals in the spinal cord. Aquaporin-4-IgG (AQP-4-IgG) was positive (1:320), and NMOSD was confirmed. Intravenous immunoglobulin and methylprednisolone were given, and the symptoms improved. She received maintenance treatment with methylprednisolone tablets, and the dosage was gradually reduced. She was readmitted for fatigue, palpitations, and shortness of breath in May 2023. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy showed elevated erythroid precursors and erythroid hypoplasia, with normal megakaryocytes and myeloid precursors. Chest CT showed no mediastinal lymph node enlargement or thymoma. PRCA secondary to NMOSD was diagnosed. Recombinant human erythropoietin was given. Her condition improved after 1.5 months, as indicated by blood cell count and imaging. Conclusions This case suggests that PRCA can be secondary to NMOSD. A comprehensive immune function and bone marrow evaluation might be necessary if abnormal blood cells are found while managing NMOSD. -> ['treatment', 'protein', 'phenotype', 'anatomy', 'disease', 'medical_procedures']\n",
      "Abstract Objective According to a seminal hypothesis stated by Crick and Koch in 1995, one is not aware of neural activity in primary visual cortex (V1) because this region lacks reciprocal connections with prefrontal cortex (PFC). Methods We provide here a neuropsychological illustration of this hypothesis in a patient with a very rare form of cortical blindness: ventral and dorsal cortical pathways were lesioned bilaterally while V1 areas were partially preserved. Results Visual stimuli escaped conscious perception but still activated V1 regions that were functionally disconnected from PFC. Interpretation These results are consistent with the hypothesis of a causal role of PFC in visual awareness. -> ['phenotype', 'anatomy', 'cognitive', 'disease']\n",
      "Bilateral femoral neuropathy is rare, especially that caused by bilateral compressive iliopsoas, psoas, or iliacus muscle hematomas. We present a case of bilateral femoral neuropathy due to spontaneous psoas hematomas developed during COVID-19 critical illness. A 41-year-old patient developed COVID-19 pneumonia, and his condition deteriorated rapidly. A decrease in the hemoglobin level prompted imaging studies during his intensive care unit (ICU) stay. Bilateral psoas hematomas were identified as the source of bleeding. Thereafter, the patient complained of weakness in both upper and lower limbs and numbness in the lower limb. He was considered to have critical illness neuropathy and was referred to rehabilitation. Electrodiagnostic testing suggested bilateral femoral neuropathy because of compression due to hematomas developed during the course of his ICU stay. The consequences of iliopsoas hematomas occurring in the critically ill can be catastrophic, ranging from hemorrhagic shock to severe weakness, highlighting the importance of recognizing this entity. -> ['treatment', 'phenotype', 'anatomy', 'disease', 'medical_procedures', 'molecule']\n",
      "Objective To report our initial clinical experience with N-hexyl cyanoacrylate (NHCA), a novel liquid agent for neurovascular embolization. Methods Four paragangliomas were treated with percutaneous embolization using NHCA as the sole embolic material. In one dural arteriovenous fistula (dAVF), NHCA was used in combination with other embolic materials. Procedural specifics, complications and angiographic results were retrospectively evaluated. Results Total or subtotal devascularization was obtained in 3 of the 4 paragangliomas. In the largest tumor, only partial devascularization could be achieved. The dAVF was completely occluded. Catheter entrapment did not occur. After dAVF treatment, the patient had an asymptomatic lacunar infarction, while there was no procedural morbidity related to paraganglioma treatment. Conclusions In this series, neurovascular embolization with NHCA was feasible and effective. It may be particularly beneficial for small and tortuous vessels that require low-profile catheterization and a slow and controlled polymerization. Further studies are necessary to prove the benefits of NHCA over established embolic agents. -> ['treatment', 'anatomy', 'disease', 'medical_procedures', 'molecule']\n",

      "ABSTRACT At the end of 2019, the [severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2](molecule) ([SARS-CoV-2](molecule)) emerged in Wuhan, China. On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization declared [COVID-19](disease) a pandemic. This [virus](molecule) affects many [organs](anatomy), including the [eye](anatomy), and can manifest through various [clinical manifestations](phenotype). Multiple [neuro-ophthalmological manifestations](phenotype) have been reported in association with [COVID-19](disease), including, [Optic Neuritis](disease), [cranial nerve palsies](disease), [eye](anatomy) movement abnormalities, and [visual field defects](disease). In this article, we report a case of [bilateral neuroretinitis](disease) in association with ([SARS-CoV-2](molecule)).\n",
      "Background Patients suffering from [refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder](disease) ([OCD](disease)) who have undergone [deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery](medical_procedures) require repeated in-person programming visits. These sessions could be labor-intensive and may not always be feasible, particularly when [in-person hospital visits](medical_procedures) are restricted. [Telemedicine](treatment) is emerging as a potential supplementary tool for post-operative care. However, its reliability and feasibility still require further validation due to the unconventional methods of interaction. Methods A study was conducted on three patients with refractory [OCD](disease) who had undergone DBS. Most of their programming sessions were completed via a remote programming system. These patients were recruited and monitored for a year. Changes in their clinical symptoms were assessed using the [Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale–Second Edition](cognitive) ([Y-BOCS-II](cognitive)), the [Hamilton Anxiety Scale-14](cognitive) (HAMA), the [Hamilton Depression Scale-17](cognitive) (HAMD), and the [Short Form 36 Health Survey Questionnaire](cognitive) (SF-36). The scores from these assessments were reported. Results At the last follow-up, two out of three patients were identified as responders, with their [Y-BOCS-II](cognitive) scores improving by more than 35% (P1: 51%, P3: 42%). These patients also experienced some [mood benefits](phenotype). All patients observed a decrease in travel expenses during the study period. No severe adverse events were reported throughout the study. Conclusion The group of patients showed improvement in their [OCD](disease) symptoms within a 1-year follow-up period after [DBS surgery](medical_procedures), without compromising safety or benefits. This suggests that [telemedicine](treatment) could be a valuable supplementary tool when in-person visits are limited.\n",
      "Background and Objective [Spontaneous intracranial hypotension](disease) ([SIH](disease)) from [CSF leak](disease) commonly produces [headache](phenotype). It also may produce [sagging brain syndrome](disease) ([SBS](disease)), often with [neurocognitive symptoms](cognitive) indistinguishable from [behavioral-variant frontotemporal dementia](disease) ([bvFTD](disease)). The authors describe a new [clinical sign](phenotype) that appears to be pathognomonic of [SBS](disease). Methods We reviewed [medical records](metadata) and [brain imaging](medical_procedures) in patients seen at our 2 centers who presented with [SIH](disease), [SBS](disease), and [bvFTD](disease) symptoms. Results There were 51 patients (12 women, 39 men) with mean age 55.5 years (range, 26–70 years). [MRI](medical_procedures) showed severe [brain sagging](phenotype) in all. Thirteen patients displayed [repetitive flexion](phenotype) with [breath-holding](phenotype) at the time of clinical presentation. Five patients had [repetitive flexion](phenotype) with [breath-holding](phenotype), which resolved before presenting for evaluation. Thus, 35.3% (18) of 51 patients with [SBS](disease) displayed seemingly compulsive [repetitive flexion](phenotype) with [breath-holding](phenotype). Discussion Compulsive [repetitive flexion](phenotype) with [breath-holding](phenotype) appears to be pathognomonic of [SBS](disease), deserving the acronym CoRFBiS (compulsive [repetitive flexion](phenotype) with [breath-holding](phenotype) in [SBS](disease)). CoRFBiS should alert the clinician to [SBS](disease) with [SIH](disease) as the proximate cause of the clinical constellation, rather than [bvFTD](disease).\n"
